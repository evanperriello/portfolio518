    <h3 class="Main-Text">The old oak is dying.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Every day, we check its bark for small holes. And my grandmother tells me to squish any beetles I see. They are small and brown, the size of a pin, and their bodies are covered in crystalline hairs.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My father cuts off those branches with beetles in them. He burns them on the grass where they fall, and you can hear the beetles screeching and popping in the flames. But still, they are winning, little by little. They are born under the bark. They suck out the sap and turn the branches brittle and dry. By the time they come out onto the surface, it is too late to save the wood underneath.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Grandma says that in my lifetime, I will see the great oak fall.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“What will happen then?” I ask her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Nothing good,” she says.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Grandma shows me the old ways. Every morning in the summer, before the sun is fully risen, she pulls me out of my bed and brings me to the base of the tree. She pricks her finger and mine. She has to dig the needle into her skin, through years of callouses, but my blood comes quick. We each let a drop fall to the ground, then we staunch the flow with a leaf.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She sings the song, which she says all the old Thorndikes used to sing.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Blood in the roots and roots in the blood.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Grandma says they used to spill their blood at noon, all in a wide circle, passing a needle from hand to hand to hand, singing the song and bowing their heads.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mom doesn’t like this, says it’s ungodly.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mom isn’t my real mother, and she isn’t a real Thorndike either. So you can’t blame her for not understanding. Her blood isn’t in the roots.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But I like her, no matter what Grandma says. She is kind and gentle, and her skin smells like vanilla in the sun.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Grandma doesn’t like anything or anyone new. She says the house is cold now, that it used to be full of life and warmth.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Sometimes I think that the tree’s sickness is the reason I’m so frail, that I can’t run, that my throat closes up like I’m drowning and my body starts to shake until I fall.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Once, I heard Grandma saying to a friend on the phone that my father was the last of the real Thorndike men, that the line would end there.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But I have powers she doesn’t know about.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When Grandma wishes to the tree that Mom would go away, I wish against her. I say without speaking that I want Mom to be protected. And no matter how much blood Grandma puts into her wishes, mine are more powerful.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Last winter, I learned this for sure.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mom was driving back from her job as a hostess at the Cracker Barrell in Sotherton. It was the worst snow in twenty years. She hit a patch of black ice that carried her truck into a ditch. When my father got the call, all they could tell him was that she was being taken to the hospital.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">On our way there, we passed the place where she had crashed. They hadn’t been able yet to clean it up. We saw the empty, rust&#45;red shell of her truck. The snow around it glittered with puzzle pieces of glass. The cab was crushed in on the top so that it was so small, a foot shorter than she was. And I thought then that she was dead. Because a body can only take so much.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I’ve never felt so sick, and I started to wheeze. I was certain I’d done something wrong, that I hadn’t wished right, that I hadn’t wished hard enough or spilled enough of my blood.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But when we got to the hospital, Mom was there sleeping, looking just as she looks when she nods off on the couch after a late&#45;night shift. Only her left arm was wrapped up, but the bandages were so white and clean that it was like a television injury.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Thrown clear, is what the nurses said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She’d be getting a cast. But it was a miracle&#45;&#45;a foot to the left or right, a different angle, different road, if her seatbelt had held her as it was meant to, instead of popping open like a piece of butcher’s twine. These are the sorts of things they told us might have made her dead. They told us lots of things that might have killed her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When she woke up, Mom talked about angels.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Since then, I haven’t wished for anything else, haven’t asked the tree for the things I used to want, like a dog or a bike or enough breath in my lungs. I just ask it to keep her safe.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t tell Grandma, because I need her to keep showing me the old ways.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I know already how to fix colds, how to keep ghosts out of the house or how to talk to them if they’re friendly. I know where to find the wild garlic and how to sniff out a curse.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And I know some things better than she knows. I know that the rhythm’s what matters, more than the words or the blood. Everything in the whole world’s got a rhythm, and the more of it you learn to hear, the more you can sing with it, the more you can take over its song.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My father’s tone is a slow one, so deep you can barely hear it, like listening to someone’s heartbeat from their wrist.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mine is fast and high&#45;pitched, like my wheezing when I run.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Grandma’s barely got a rhythm anymore. She fades in and out, like an old recording. Sometimes, when the house is quiet, I listen as hard as I can, and I can hear the stars and the oak and the clacking beetles, and even the low thrum of the house. But nothing from her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She said that when she passes, she’s going to leave me everything she has. But she told me it’s not much. She said her real power’s gone before her to wait on the other side. She told me that when she was a girl, not much older than me, she could’ve done anything.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Why didn’t you? I asked her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And she said she did, but that she did the wrong things, that her whole life she’s always done the wrong things. She had so much power, she said, that she didn’t realize there were others out there who had power as well, who could have power over her if she let them. She fell in love with shadows. She had my father, and that’s when her power started to fade.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For so long, it was just the two of them, so many years alone in the house, running circles around the old oak. Then my real Momma came, and before she passed, she left me. I was born halfway through her death, when her body couldn’t feed me anymore, couldn’t push the blood to my throat or lungs.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Another day, another hour. I was a miracle, my Grandma told me. She told me all the things that might’ve made me dead.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One time, I asked Grandma why my father’s got no powers like her and me, why he doesn’t come out to the tree and bleed like we do. She said he used to, that every day he’d go out there with her in the sun and sing the song.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But he stopped long ago. Years and years, she said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Sometimes, when my father’s chopping limbs off the old oak, when he’s cutting deep into the tangled branches, he looks about to cry. And I watch his face. He looks up at me now and again, and I know where all his power’s gone. I hear from the rhythm of him that he used all his wishes up for me, that all his blood became my blood. And he’s just sore I couldn’t have taken more, that it couldn’t make me whole.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Every night, I wonder about the day when I’ll be alone. When Grandma is gone and my wishes stop working for Mom and Dad. I think the tree will last til then. I think it will stay standing long after its branches are gone, past when the beetles have chewed away at its hollowed bones. It’ll just be me and what’s left of the tree, and when it falls, if it ever falls, its roots will pull from so deep that the whole house will crack, and the blood of all the Thorndikes will come bubbling up, like a geyser, like a jet of oil from the ground. Years and centuries of blood. Enough to wash clean the earth.</h3>
