    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man only comes into the shop to stay dry on rainy afternoons. We are next door to his office building. He never carries an umbrella, yet he hates getting wet.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">We do not sell umbrellas here. We sell mementos from other people’s lives—photo books, tarnished jewelry, half&#45;finished paint&#45;by&#45;numbers, diplomas, and company&#45;league trophies.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I own the shop. Business is good because everyone works too much. Families and romance, sports and art—we like the ideas of them but don’t have the time. Even me—I am there to see the man waddle in and waddle back out. I am there to see all the buildings around me fill and empty of similar men in similar grey suits, there to serve them as they stumble through, looking for pictures of women who could be their wives or children who could be their kids.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And what do I have? My mother is sick. I barely see her. She may die before I visit her again. I have a brown and white cat named Norman who spends his days lying in the window, but he is like everything in this shop—I can only pretend that he is mine.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Norman is a runaway. He likes chasing mice, and he likes sitting in the sun, which makes this the perfect place for him. There’s a name on his collar, a number and an address—someplace far across town. But I don’t have a car to drive him back, and I don’t have the heart to pick up the phone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It’s been three years now, and every day I worry that his owner will walk by, spot the cat in the window, and accuse me of doing exactly what I’ve done.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t know when I first took an interest in the man. It must have been a rainy day. Weather affects us more than we care to admit—moisture in the air swells the brain.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It is not love, exactly.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He is far too large, though he has a kind face. His beard and hair, grey and black, could be nice. But he lets them grow until his beard begins to tangle and his hair sits flat on his shoulders.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mothering instinct. That’s what Michelle would call it. She would say that I wanted to fix him, to comb out the knots in his hair and straighten his tie.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Today the sky is cloudy, and I am anxious for rain. And when the first bee&#45;sized drops begin to splash on the concrete, I nearly jump.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For the next two hours, I speak to the rain, tapping my tongue against the back of my teeth in a silent incantation: “keep coming,” I say, “keep coming.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The water swarms to dips in the sidewalk. It makes puddles and angry brown streams, carrying slimy blossom leaves down gutters to the bottom of the hill. I put a bucket and a coatrack at the front of the store.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">At five, not a minute after, the man steps through the door, his wide face caught in a sneer as he slaps at his shoulders, beating water out of his coat. He takes in a deep breath, then pushes it out through the strands of his beard so that they arc like spider webs caught in a wind. He shuffles out of his bright coat and hangs it on the rack, then unbuttons his cuffs and rolls up his sleeves to the elbow.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Hello,” I say, “what are you looking for?” Many of the men who come through here are in a rush. They need a memory of a mother, a father, a child. They need a memory of lost love with desperate urgency, as though it were water or food.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Just browsing,” he says, and he begins to shuffle about.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He is large—350, 400 pounds—so he has to be careful weaving through the narrow lines of overstocked shelves. Michelle used to scold me, said the fire commissioner would have a field day. “Nothing burns like old things,” she said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I stay at the front counter and ring up the other customers. There is a young black woman in a pencil skirt and stiff jacket who buys a teddy bear missing one arm, an older man who buys three lockets—he always buys lockets, and a young man with red&#45;rimmed eyes and thick stubble who buys a pair of baby shoes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Still, I keep an eye on the large man. He is crouched down now, huddled over a bin full of&nbsp; toys. He runs one finger along their surfaces, the worn and matted furs, the glossy, cracked plastics. He is careful, like a well&#45;behaved child.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The rush is over shortly. Everyone wants to get home to their own apartments to find places for their new old things.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man is the only one left inside. “It’s really coming down,” he says.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The rain is ferocious. Water cascades down the windows in steady, twisting streams. The shops at the bottom of the hill have water coming right up to their doors. I picture stockrooms and basements starting to flood.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;“Sure is,” I say.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Every once in a while, the man will grab an item from the shelves and cradle it in his palm as he walks around the store. He never buys anything, and I believe this action is for my benefit, to give the appearance that he’s weighing a purchase, giving it real thought, before ultimately he decides against it and puts the item back in its place. Right now he is carrying a picture frame. He brings it up to the counter. “This woman,” the man says, tapping one thick finger against the glass, “she looks familiar.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It takes me a moment to realize that it’s Michelle.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When Michelle disappeared, the police suspected foul play. The chairs and tables in her apartment had been knocked to the floor. There was an old vase that lay shattered near the kitchen. And her wallet, phone, and keys were all still there.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">They taped off the doors and filed reports, posted notices. But disorder was the only evidence. There was no jealous boyfriend or ex&#45;husband, no reports of bumps or shouts in the night from her neighbors. It was a week before her landlord was allowed inside, and when he went in, he called me.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I spent days packing everything in boxes. Clearing out the back of her closet, I felt like a stranger. There was a small, worn softball glove with her name written in permanent marker on its thumb. In school photographs, she was stocky with brown, curled hair, not the long, blond waves I had envied. She must have dyed it obsessively to keep the roots so well hidden. It took me hours of comparing the shape of her face to recognize the woman I’d known.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It occurred to me that she hadn’t died, that she had transformed. There would be a new woman walking around, so wholly different from Michelle that even if I recognized her, I wouldn’t be able to approach her or speak to her. It would be like spotting a ghost.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I didn’t know what else to do with her possessions. I brought them here to the stockroom and let them mix with the other items until they became diluted, untraceable.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;“She was a friend of mine,” I say. “She used to keep me company. You must have seen her here at the shop.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“No,” the man says. “That’s not right.” He brings his left hand up to his lips, where he taps three fingers against the soft skin and hair. His eyes are focused so tightly on the photograph. In it, Michelle is eighteen, sitting on a patch of grass with her retriever, then only a puppy. She is looking up at the camera with a smile and shy eyes, the sort of look we reserve for those we love. By the time she disappeared, the dog was old and weak, half&#45;blind and barely able to make it up a flight of steps. The landlord didn’t want him, so I took him home. Over the next two years, every time I lifted his shivering back legs and pushed on his boney rump, I said Michelle’s name as a curse.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Not here,” the man says. “She looks like someone famous.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The water is climbing its way up the hill. The shops at the bottom of the street are now flooding in earnest, the mud shouldering in through cracks in doors and breaking glass windows with sharp branches. Never in my life have I seen rain like this. “There will be no trains,” I say.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man looks outside, as though not comprehending.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It must be a hurricane. I find an old Bakelite radio. Its knob is broken, so I have to turn it on with a pair of needle&#45;nosed pliers. The heavy static just adds to the whooshing of the rain.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I move to the window seat, where Norman is lying fast asleep. I pick him up by the middle of his back, and he arches to nip at me, but when I give him a scratch, he starts to purr.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“When will it stop?” the man asks me.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I don’t know,” I say. “I never follow the news.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“The news!” the man exclaims. “Of course,” he says, “I saw her on the news.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Yes,” I nod, “It’s possible.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I remember now. A tragedy,” he says, “So young, so beautiful. You knew her, you said?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“It wouldn’t be a tragedy if she were ugly like me?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When you say something like this, you have to watch the face carefully. You have to catch every emotion that travels across lips and eyes. Shock, horror, shame, and a hint of anger before settling on penitence.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“That’s not what I meant,” the man says, “not at all. It’s just... I’m sorry. But it would be a tragedy. I mean, you are beautiful too. Not that it matters. But you are.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He pauses, rubs one hand through his mottled hair and looks back at the photograph. “She was new to town, wasn’t she? Isn’t that what they said? She had just moved here, just before.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“No,” I tell him. “She always lived here.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“But the news said.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I should know,” I tell him.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Odd,” the man says, “that I should remember so well. These things happen all the time, of course. Every other night, it seems, there’s another young woman missing in the city. But something about her. And it was such an unusual case.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The water is climbing its way up the hill. The shops at the bottom of the street are all but covered in the murky, swirling grey. I can see flat, unfolded pink boxes from the cupcake shop gliding on top of the water, fanning out before diving like ducks beneath the surface. For the first time it occurs to me that it may not stop before it reaches us.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But Norman seems calm in my hands. Animals are supposed to be attuned to the weather. Either we are safe, or Norman is shit at being a cat.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man, though, is nervous. He begins to scratch his head and pace. The ends of his pant legs, still damp from the rain outside, swish against one another in a steady slap&#45;slap. “Tell me,” he says, “where did you meet her?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I tell him I don’t remember. Long friendships are like that, a blurred chain of memories with no discernible start.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“At school?” the man asks.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I try to picture her wearing a backpack or cradling a stack of books with her long, pale arms. I imagine her sawing away at a plastic tray full of food with a dull knife, looking up at me with a shy smile on her lips. But though I can see these images, I can’t connect them to anything, to the dorms or the dining hall. They seem to happen in a vacuum.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I tell the man that probably, yes, it was at school, but as I said, I can’t remember.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man snorts. He doesn’t believe me. His face is piggish. His scraggly beard is the scraggly beard of a sad, lonely, awful man.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“What would you know?” I ask him. “What would you know about it anyway?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Was it true, what they said about how they found her?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Found her. The words catch me. If they found her, why didn’t she come back to her apartment? Why wouldn’t she come back for her glove, for her dog? “No,” I say, “they never found her.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“But the papers said.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I feel like a fool for wishing the rain here. “Don’t tell me what they said.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man stops. He looks down at me on the window seat. It is like he is peering down from the edge of a cliff into a deep, wide gulley. Then he looks back at the photo.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">His face smoothes and takes on a smile. “Of course. I think that must be it, why I remember so well.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man turns from me. “I once knew a girl who looked very like her. When this girl was on the news, I used to think to myself every time her picture popped up, ‘oh God, is that my Laura?’ It gave me a start. I watched anxiously right up to the moment that I learned the girl’s name, that it wasn’t Laura at all. And then I continued to watch, to read every article I could find about the girl. She looked so like her, you see? And Laura—even then, I hadn’t seen her for years. ‘My Laura,’ I always thought, though I had no right to call her that, or even think of her in that way.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I feel tears on my cheeks. I can barely breathe, and I let out a loud sniff. The man turns to me, as though he had forgotten I was there.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I’m sorry,” he says. “I suppose I got excited at the idea of learning more. I thought you could tell me about the girl. But you don’t even know what I do. Odd how these things work, isn’t it?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man is trying to make peace, but when he reaches down to pet Norman in my lap, the cat digs his claws deep into the man’s skin. He pulls away, and the cat goes with his hand, landing heavily on the floor.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I stand up, and I feel my palms pushing on the man’s soft chest, sinking in before meeting the resistance of his rib cage. It’s like pushing on a wire&#45;spring mattress.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He falls back into a shelf, and I hear the sharp sound of shattering glass. The man stumbles away, apologizing, but I throw everything I can find at him as he goes to the door. When, finally, he gets outside, I lock the bolt and sink down onto the floor.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I find the picture in its broken frame. I am trying to remember her, trying so hard to place her here, standing beside the counter. How many years? But no matter how hard I try to conjure her image, she is stiff, her face held in that same, shy smile with which she looks up from the lawn at the camera—a lawn I can’t place, outside of a building—a school building I don’t know. Up at whom? A father, a mother, a boyfriend? Who did she love so dearly that I never met?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I set the picture down and begin to gather other items from the floor.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;All of these beautiful items I own, each one full of potential memories. This watch with the missing dial—it could be my grandfather’s, bought with pay from the war. This pearl choker could be from an aunt, a beautiful woman with raven hair, a stylish woman who died too young. These black and white cufflinks from a former love who left in the summer, when the cicadas sang sorrow. This soft, simple string and bead bracelet, I am sure, must be my mother’s, given to me the last time I visited her in the hospital.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Outside, the man is tapping at the glass. He is drenched now and I can see that in the frenzy he didn’t grab his coat, that it’s hanging still on the rack inside. His tapping is soft, low, sorrowful, and the water twirls down the long, thin lines of his beard. There will be no trains, no cabs, no buses. I do not know where the man will go.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Norman mews and rubs his ear against the back of my hand until I lift him up and hold him close against my chest. He is mine. He is mine.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;</h3>
