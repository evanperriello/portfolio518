Do not try to tame a tiger. The moment you raise in yourself the expectation that you can “tame” a tiger is the moment the tiger wins. Winning, for tigers, is having a full, fresh meal. Winning, for humans, is not becoming that meal. 2.
Begin, if you can, with a small tiger, a cub. A cub, at first, is no more trouble than a large house cat. At first.
3. Tigers, unlike lions, are not social animals. In the jungle, they roam for months without seeing another stripe of orange or black. If you have, in the past, trained a lion, forget the experience. It will not help you here. To go from training a lion to training a tiger is like training a dog and then attempting to train a squirrel. The latter has no reason to like you. He has no inclination to please.
4.
Make the tiger comfortable, but not too comfortable. In the wild, tigers do not have duvets. They grow anxious, angry in the midst of eider down and Egyptian cotton.
5.
Do not associate yourself with food. For other animals (lions, say) this can be a useful tool—the carrot to the rod. For tigers, it is extremely ill&#45;advised.
6.
Do not look the tiger directly in the eye.
7.
Never turn your back on the tiger.
8.
When you suffer heartache, it is inadvisable to confide in the tiger. Though the tiger is quiet, astute, though he has warm, golden eyes. What the tiger hears from you today, he remembers tomorrow. And tomorrow, it may be advantageous for him to know, for example, how heartbroken you were at the end of All Dogs Go to Heaven. When the tiger asks you what’s wrong, it is best to bite your lip, shrug your shoulders in an almost bored way, and say simply, “nothing. I’m fine. Why do you ask?”
9.
Tigers are not above blackmail.
10.
When planning an outing with your tiger, be prepared. Other people may not understand. You will have to tell them not to use flash photography—not because it will bother the tiger or injure him (it won’t), but because the flashes on most cameras are not adequate to capture the tiger in a flattering way. Instead, they will give the impression, as they always do, that the tiger is drunk, sleep deprived, perhaps even demonic. They will conjure up images in the viewer’s head of mugshots and license photos, images taken in moments of stress under harsh fluorescents. Be protective of your tiger and his image.
11.
Now and again, the tiger will ask you for a favor. This is his way of testing you. Never dismiss him offhand. A tiger’s pride is easily wounded. If the favor is something small—say salting his meat before you pass it through the bars, then oblige him. If, however, the favor is something unreasonable—stealing a live antelope from the zoo, for example, then you must refuse and not give in no matter how he begs, no matter how often he mocks you (“I suppose,” the tiger may say, “a real man would have no trouble stealing an antelope. But then again, you did cry at All Dogs Go to Heaven”).
12.
Tigers are notoriously skilled at peer pressure.
13.
The tiger always notices. You will turn on the television, flick through the channels before settling on a rerun of MASH, and from the corner of his cage where he normally sleeps, where he is curled up with his eyes closed and where his chest is rising and falling like dough, you will hear him remark, softly, “This episode again? You watched this, what, last week?” You will get halfway into the show, and then the tiger will say (under his breath, but loud enough that you can hear), “what a shame to be so lonely.”
14.
The tiger will begin to make suggestions. “There must be some nice bars, nice restaurants nearby…I could teach you to dance; women love a man who can dance…” You will come home to find your laptop cord running through the bars of his cage, and when he passes the computer back to you, gently, at your urging, you will find that he has pulled up profiles on a dating site—beautiful women with nervous, toothy smiles. “I just thought,” the tiger will say, “you might need some help.”
15.
The next day, you will be at work, filling in spreadsheets, and you will think back to the dating site. Some of those profiles weren’t uninteresting. One woman with bright red hair and eyes of burnt umber had listed your favorite book as her own, and the comment she made about it—that the main character, really, was not a hero but was determined to destroy himself—shadowed thoughts you have often had, thoughts that served as the basis of your senior thesis, in fact.
16.
You will return to the dating site on your work computer. You will try to sign up for a profile, only to find that your email address has already been used. And when you enter your email password (the same password you use for everything, really) you will find that a profile has already been set up, and it is not entirely inaccurate, if a bit boastful. There will be one message waiting in your inbox from the woman with red hair—Alessandra is her name. “I can’t wait,” it will say.
17.
You will be angry, at first. You will walk instead of taking the bus home, because you will feel the need to burn off the sense of betrayal, the sense of shame. But as you cross Sturrow Drive, you will find your feet moving more slowly, touching the ground with a light, rhythmic step. “I can’t wait,” she had said.
18.
Berate the tiger. He must be made to understand that what he did was wrong—a fundamental breach of trust. But by the time you get home, your anger will be nothing but show. You will try to hide how excited you are at the prospect of meeting this woman—meeting any woman, in fact, after so many years (it is solitary work, raising a tiger). “I’m sorry,” the tiger will say, “you’re right. I will never do it again. But just in case, in case you did feel like going—and I completely understand why you wouldn’t want to—I pressed your suit.”
19.
Remember to pull out your shirt, just a bit, to hide your belt. Smooth your hair, but avoid using gel. Gel makes you look like either a politician or an overeager teenager (or an overeager teenage politician). It is not attractive.
20.
Do not order pasta or salad. Despite your mother’s frequent reprimands, you have never learned how to eat pasta without slurping (thirty&#45;three years old, and still you eat like a child). And in this fine, rustic Italian restaurant (the tiger made the reservation, told you to tip extra well for the table on the third&#45;floor balcony from which the streetlights below look like orderly stars) the salad is hand&#45;torn, leaving romaine leaves the size of small surfboards that you will struggle to fit into your mouth before realizing you must cut them. Instead, order a small steak (8 ounces) with new potatoes and greens.
21.
Discuss books with Alessandra. You have forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by other readers, to have that high&#45;energy back and forth that ties, by metaphor and theme and style, every author to every other throughout history, making an invisible web that seems to cradle you in a deeper understanding of shared humanity. Laugh openly. Drink more wine than you ever do (you do not even, as a rule, drink wine, preferring the light lager that they sell for half&#45;price at the liquor store near your house).
22.
Do not look overly surprised when she laughs too, that charming old&#45;fashioned way she has of covering her teeth when she smiles. Ask her about herself. Nod solemnly when she tells you that her parents were killed in India, a crazed gunman. Suddenly understand that this sadness is the source of her true beauty, a hidden layer that separates her from the smiling, flat faces of women in magazines and the billboards that glare down at you from the tops of buildings on Commonwealth Ave.
23.
When the moment comes, after you stand up and leave the restaurant, your head full of helium, kiss her. And she will smile. Invite her back to your place for a drink. But when she nods, you must tell her that the tiger is there. Had you thought of it before, you would have waited, of course, gotten her a cab, called for a second date, perhaps a third. The revelation of a tiger is not a first&#45;date sort of thing. But she will not be deterred. In fact, if anything, this will make her more eager, more interested.
24.
Pretend you are cooler than you are. Now you are exotic. You are interesting. You are a man who trains a tiger, not a sad administrative assistant who can recite the lines of Klinger from memory.
25.
When you open the door, the tiger will pretend to be asleep. “Oh my god,” the woman will say, “he’s so beautiful!” At this, the tiger will raise his head an inch off the ground, give a large huff, then return his chin to its cradle on the back of his massive paw. But you will notice the corners of his mouth tug into a slight smile.
26.
Offer her a drink, and slowly, by wavering, uncertain steps, you will move to the bedroom. She will push you backwards so that you sit on the bed. Then she will ask you where the bathroom is. You will point out, past the door, back into the light of the living room, just past the tiger’s cage. “Don’t go anywhere,” she will say.
27.
Sit in the dark and try not to shake with anxious energy. Should you undress? No. What if she comes back and finds you naked here and is shocked, surprised? And besides, you have not been taking care of yourself. You are a rotund bundle of pale flesh, like a steamed pork bun. In your suit, you still pass as a human being, something to which she might be attracted after so much wine and talk of books. Wait for what seems like an extraordinarily long time. Hear some strange noises, the clinking of metal.
28.
Just as you are about to rise, she walks into the room. She doesn’t look at you, not directly, and from this angle, her eyes are darker. They blend with the shadows in the room. You know that something is wrong before you see, dangling from the index finger on her right hand, a large, open metal padlock, like the one you use to fasten the tiger’s cage.
29.
You will hear a low noise, a purring, like a fan chopping the air. “She’s one in a million,” the tiger will say as he pads forward, out of the light of the living room, circling the edge of your bed. “Do you know how hard it is to find a woman like her? A book lover, an actress. Most important of all, though, an animal rights activist.” You will feel the tiger’s breath on your shins. “Oh, but the wonders of modern technology. They do make things easier, don’t they?”
30.
You will look up to the woman—Alessandra, whatever her name may be. Her eyes will be watching you now, peering through low hanging strands of red hair. She will smile and turn around, then drop the padlock as she leaves the room.
31.
