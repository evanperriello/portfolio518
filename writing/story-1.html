   <img class="colelem" id="u498-139" src="images/u498-139.png" alt="1. The man without skin stands in a clearing. He looks up at the sun, reaches toward it with one hand, as though he could lift the burning orb with his fingers. His jaw opens, swallowing rays like raindrops. His lidless eyes are startled by the brightness and beauty.
2. The man without skin walks down the high street. His gluteal muscles pull apart slightly when they contract. He sees women and men in shining white clothing. He smells strong coffee from the cafes and smiles at the baristas who offer him samples of chocolate biscotti. No one mentions that the man has no skin. They do not remark that he is the color of over&#45;sauced spaghetti and that the fibers covering his body change as they fill with oxygen&#45;rich blood and contract. He purchases a small brown porkpie hat, but when he gets it home, he realizes it is far too small for his head.
3. The man without skin falls in love. But the object of his affection is unaware of him. He cannot approach her, peeled as he is. He weaves himself a covering, buys rolls of soft leather, and spends hours seeking sewing patterns online. He shows up at the small bookstore where the object of his affections works. He chats with her about the new volume of poems by the Hungarian author he very much admires. He asks her to join him for a crépe across the street. She agrees, and she smiles at him. Her cheeks become high arches. If she were without skin, he would see the lines surrounding her jaw stretch taut like bowstrings. The man without skin devours his crépe, and the woman slices hers into small pieces with her fork, picking at it shyly, though after she stops eating, she continues to look down at her plate. The man without skin congratulates himself on the short strands of horsehair he has woven into the leather, making eyebrows held in a perpetual, gentle arch. But the leather grows uncomfortable—it slides on the plasma that covers his muscles, and it itches and stings when it separates from his flesh. And when the date is over and the object of his affections kisses him, he cannot feel her at all. It is just like remaining unkissed.
4. The man without skin was not always this way. As a boy, he was terribly frightened of the dark. He would leave lights on throughout the house, and if he went into a room and emerged to find the hall light had been turned off, he would call for his mother to come and walk with him to the next lighted space. His immediate family was understanding, but he had one cruel uncle who made his living travelling the country, selling portable gas ranges. This uncle would stay with them whenever the roads carried him to the southwest. Once, when the boy and his uncle were alone in the house together, the uncle snuck out and cut the power. The boy was terrified and would not move, only screamed for his mother. Then the uncle, dressed wholly in black, grabbed the boy from behind, and the boy screeched and ran away so quickly, that though his uncle held him tight, he broke free and ran out of his own skin, leaving it as a lizard leaves its tail. But unlike a lizard’s tail, it never grew back. No doctor could help. The boy’s skin withered like an orange rind left in the sun.
5. When the man without skin needs money, he calls up the medical and art schools. He particularly likes the art schools. He’s allowed to pose any way he desires—often he just sits, but at times he is more fanciful. He leans back and lets his abdominals become taut like ships’ riggings. He holds up his arms and lets them see how like wings are the latissimus dorsi. He drinks a glass of water and demonstrates for the students how much action is required by the body to do such a simple task. At times, even if he has plenty of money, he will call up the art school simply because he is feeling down. It is the only time he feels beautiful. The medical students, on the other hand, look at him with thinking eyes. They see him as a problem, a puzzle to be solved. He often wakes up in the middle of the night, startled by some small noise or discomfort, the need to urinate, and he can’t sleep again, because his mind re&#45;enters the cycle of seeking answers. He gets the most reading done at these times, when the only way he can turn off this torturous loop is by entering the voice and mind of someone else. For weeks after visiting the medical school, he has trouble sleeping, which is why, though they pay much better than the art school, he only goes to them rarely, when he becomes overwhelmed by the demands of the rent, after binges of self&#45;indulgent spending on gadgets and movies, books, albums, and art for his walls.
6. What bothers the man without skin most of all is the sense that he is object, never subject. He is a corollary to life, a secondary player, a distraction. He has never been able to hold a job. Few places will hire him, and those that will come with their own limitations. He worked for a time in an electronics store. But no matter how hard he worked, his boss would not promote him out of the back room where he entered and maintained the inventory records.
Most days, the man without skin is alone. He has thought often of ways to capitalize on his solitude, has dabbled in art and writing. For a time, he created homemade exercise videos and met with some success. But most of his hours are squandered. He is now only twenty&#45;seven and cannot imagine another fifty years spent the same way.
7. It is late in July when the man without skin goes down to the river. He peels off his black polo shirt and khakhi shorts. The air is warm and soothing like bathwater. Far away he sees a team of rowers from the nearby university. They speed across the glittering white tips of the water, pushed by the current and their rhythmic, human motion. Beside them, there are a few geese and swans, ducks and smaller birds, the black buffleheads that expand their skulls with puffs of air. He wades through the long grass, the water chestnuts that have escaped cultivation and here grow wildly, voraciously, swallowing up swathes of the river. They wrap around him, almost seem to grasp him with their thin, green arms. He is a strong swimmer. And he moves quickly forward, out to the middle, farther than he has ever swum before. He swims until the breath heaves his ribs out, pushes his latissimus dorsi out like wings, like fins. He feels the rush of the current, how strong, how overwhelming it is. He takes a last breath and then dives down as far as he can, toward the bottom where no one will find him. It is not until he is almost out of air that he panics, that what he’s doing dawns on him and he begins to kick frantically up. But the current is an inescapable hand, and he is in the middle of its palm. It pushes him. He has no control now. This clarity, or this fear, is no use.
8. The man without skin wakes on the shore. A small crowd stands above him. The sand and gravel stick to his back. Someone is listening to his heart. When he speaks, the people jump. Some run. But the man who crouches above him, who must have revived him, stays put. A thousand tiny streams curve down his skin. He asks, “Are you alright?”
9. When he gets home, the man without skin calls his parents. It is late, but the time difference favors an insomniac. His parents have grown old. He can hear it on the phone. And when they say they miss him, he has to strain to keep back tears.
Whose dream is this? he wonders. He makes up news for his parents. He doesn’t tell them about his swim.
10. The man without skin calls the object of his affection. He asks her to come over, tries not to sound too desperate. But he also knows that he needs her to come over. His spine is curling itself into a tight hook. His legs shake from worry at the length of the night. He imagines himself the way an art student would draw him. Anatomy of desperation. It is only after she agrees and he hangs up that he realizes that his apartment has remained hidden from any other eyes for nearly a year, that this is exactly the sort of impression he does not want to make. And then, he remembers the fake skin.
Putting it on is a delicate process. He has to be careful not to tear the fibers of his muscles, not to let it stick to him before it’s in place. For his date he had spent a good two hours shimmying in and smoothing it down. Now he has fifteen minutes. He thrusts in one leg, but the leather ankle catches against his toes and then stretches with his force. The pain is deep and jaw&#45;clenching when the inside grips and pulls at his muscles. He doesn’t make it past his knees before he hears the cab’s horn outside. He goes to the window and stretches out one sinewy arm. It is too dark for her to see him. “Come up,” he shouts. He buzzes her in, unlocks the door, and runs into the bathroom with the suit of leather.
He pulls. He strains. Hears her open the front door, the sound of its hinge a low, intestinal groan. “Just a second,” he yells, because this is the only thing he can think to yell from the inside of a bathroom. “Are you okay?” she asks him. He struggles with all his strength. The leather tears at its seams, the ones he was going to try to pass off as surgery scars, if it came to that. He is well versed in the language of medicine, has heard so many soon&#45;to&#45;be doctors murmur, pointing at his flesh. But now there is a long tear right across the suit’s chest, spiraling up to the throat, a tear that makes it easy to slide into but which also renders it useless. The skin forms a loose tent around his sternum and hangs away from his Adam’s apple in a long curve, like a turkey’s waddle. He puts it on anyway, puts on a pair of shorts, grabs the door handle, and lets out a deep breath. He asks her to turn out all of the lights. He turns the knob and opens the door. There is only a pale sodium glow of streetlights through the curtains. He sees her shape but not her eyes, her hair, her skin. The line of the windowsill cuts her off at the shins so that she seems to float in the darkness. She calls him by his name. He can see her move forward, slightly, sees the shadow growing larger. And again he is just a child. He has never been anything other than a child clutching at a doorframe, afraid to step out into a darkened room.
He places his hand on the wall and fumbles for a light switch. “Oh my god,” she says, moving towards him. “Oh my god. What happened? Are you alright?”
11. He spends an hour trying to convince her that he doesn’t need a doctor. All the while, he holds the skin as close to his body as he can, hopes she doesn’t notice that there is no blood, that the inside edge is tanned and dry. Though it is hot, he pulls a turtleneck from his closet and puts it on so that the gap of broken skin is small, barely a mark. He asks her to come with him, outside. He says he needs fresh air, that it’s all he needs. They catch the first train of the morning. The sun is not yet up, and the only other riders are bakers and emergency room doctors on their way to work. They go down to the harbor walk, and though it is always crowded, full of tourists and guides, foodcart vendors selling roasted nuts by smell alone, it is deserted at this hour. Even the boats are asleep. She makes a joke that they are the last ones alive on the planet. And he asks her what she would do if that were the case. She kisses him once, square on his soft leather lips. This time, he feels it, though it is only a pressure, like a hand pressing on a gloved palm. And then she begins to run out ahead of him, shouting to the lumbering buildings that surround them. “Hellooo,” she shouts. “Helloooo.”
She turns, and she smiles and then darts off and away, weaving through a small patch of grass, stone steps, their fountain jets, their lights not yet turned on. He gives chase, but she is quick, and now that he is after her, she is determined. Her long legs force him into a full run. He feels the warm summer wind on the front of his neck, feels its touch expand, and he knows that the leather is peeling away with his movements, that it’s baring his open mouth, the tip of his nose. She runs on, not looking back, through the offices and closed&#45;up shops, the red brick and pebble streets. The last of his false face flies up, gets in the way of his sight, so he tears it away, just to spot her as she ducks around corners. The air is soothing and smooth. He doesn’t care any more, cannot afford to care. He is the last man on earth. “Hellooo!” he hears her call, the echo on the city’s old stone: “Helloooo!” " width="920" height="4262"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
