Listen carefully to the church bells. Drown out the rest: the idle party chatter, the river&#45;like whoosh of nighttime traffic, the half&#45;ironic, half&#45;nostalgic grunge music wrenching itself from laptop speakers. Listen. Count the bells. Nine when there should be eight. Ten when there should be nine. That’s how you know something has gone wrong.
2. Heights
You have always been afraid of heights. As a child, you couldn’t bring yourself to help your father put up Christmas decorations. Instead, you stayed on the ground, holding the ladder. And you have always thought of yourself in this way—support. You are exactly the type of person for whom “Wind Beneath My Wings” was written.
But still, at the moment, you find yourself drawn to the window. You hang out over the fifth floor, bracing your hip against the sill, tipping on it like a board on a fulcrum. Down below, you can see something moving. Many things. In the dark, in the shadows, they are ragged shapes, inkblots on asphalt and cracked red brick. You lean further and further, until someone behind you shouts and someone else grabs your ankles, and together they pull you in.
“Sorry,” you say. “I don’t know what came over me.”
3. Certainty
This is something you’ve suspected about the world for a long time: it is larger than anyone admits. The acknowledged world believes only in itself and therefore never looks to the horizon, never tries to distinguish strange shapes among the clouds.
Certainty is the problem. Scientific or religious. Certainty in all stripes, all colors, all modes, all manners.
When you were a boy, you read fantasy novels because they spoke to a hidden part of you, the uncertain place in your heart and mind—the animal part that still jumps when it hears a rattling in the bushes, that still builds long claws from the tendrils of trees.
You have realized, of course, that survival in society, on this small island of certainty, relies on your pretending to be certain as well. So whenever your wife hears a noise in the apartment, you say that it’s just the wind, while your mind spins over the sound, dissecting the tenor and the placement, the height from which the sound came, the level of threat and level of accidental bumbling implied by the short clatter of pots, the creaking of cabinet doors (a creaking is always more unsettling than a clatter, because it implies a level of conscious deliberation, a desire to remain undetected, and the fine motor control of fingers.) And here, at the party, you talk about all of the certain things. You discuss your job as a data analyst, your friends and memories and memories of friends, the particular brand of coffee that you choose to drink in the morning and your reasons for having chosen it out of all the potential brands of coffee on all the potential store shelves in your neighborhood. You pass off your own strange behavior, your leaning and almost falling to see in the dark. You say, “I must have had one too many,” which is the “it’s just the wind” of adult behavior—that ill&#45;fitting aegis that covers all of the hard&#45;to&#45;explain phenomena of human existence: the crying jags, the shuddering fear, the inexplicable happiness that overtakes you at times and makes you laugh like a child. Some, it should be noted, find this excuse so helpful that they spend the entirety of their lives having “one too many” in an effort to make the unmanageable appear manageable, the uncertain certain.
4. Dreams
There are different classes of dream: bad dream, nightmare, night terror.
Night terrors are real in the space of the mind. They leave you with memories—sights, sounds, smells, and feelings—as rich as any from waking life.
Three days ago, you woke in your room to see your wife standing naked at the window—her weight tilted onto her right foot—swaying slightly back and forth, so that her long black hair made a pendulum against the white glow of her skin. Outside, the moon was fuller than you had ever seen. You held your breath the way one does when approaching a deer, certain that an inhalation could spook the creature. And you watched her there for what seemed like hours, though you knew even then that time had lost its meaning. You felt the new strangeness of this place before you knew why, before you heard the bells in the distance, clanging again and again: ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
The air smelled like rain, but there were no clouds, just the moon, cobalt and silver, with no stars visible in its light.
You stood up, moved quietly to the window. Placed a hand on her shoulder, its skin cool and soft and smooth, and you looked out, stood on your toes to see what she was seeing.
She did not shift, did not stop her swaying, so that you were pulled into her gentle rhythm. And you noticed, so soft that you could barely hear it, that she was humming, not a song but an atonal something, like a car alarm muted by hundreds of layers of linen.
For a long time, you saw nothing. The street was empty. All of the streets you could see, and it seemed as though you could see the whole city there from your window, were completely empty.
But then you began to notice differences, slight differences of quality, in the shadows on the street. You saw dark figures moving, clinging to the negative space of the night, and the overall effect was of a swarm, an ocean swell partially obscured, viewed through half&#45;open fingers. You watched for a moment to confirm and reconfirm.
The moon began to shrink. The shadows grew outward, toward your little apartment, and along with them the indistinguishable shapes.
You took a half&#45;step back, and that was when you noticed your own reflection. There, over the pale crescent of your wife’s shoulder. You were not happy, and yet your reflection was smiling. More: it was straining the sides of its face in a long, pale&#45;lipped showing of teeth, teeth that seemed too large to fit inside a human skull. It was the face of something else. The smile, or grimace, of a madman.
5. Data
They say that you are what you do.
If that’s true, then this is what you are: data. Sheets and sheets, columns that stretch as far as the scrollbar can see.
You work for a third&#45;tier internet search company that is trying to become a first&#45;tier internet search company so that it can pay back its venture&#45;capitalist financiers, men with impeccable Honolulu tans and Gucci suits that they wear unbuttoned, unironed, to give a sense of the effortlessness of their affluence, and yet who look at you as though they might grind your skin between their teeth.
You receive the failed searches. When a user enters a search term but doesn’t click on any of the links that come up, that’s a failed search. It is your job to go through all of these search terms and find patterns, figure out what went wrong so that the programmers can rewrite the algorithm, make it more responsive.
Ninety percent of the failed searches you see are typos, user errors. But the remaining ones straddle a fine line between the confounding and the mystical. You look for patterns in the data, not just because it’s your job, but because you feel somehow that you are being presented with a list of everything a human being can want and not find.
Sometimes you sit at your desk, reading over the words like a mantra in a soft whisper, singing them to yourself as meaningless phrases.
You have lost hours this way, and no one around you notices, because they are buried in their own numbers, in their data.
6. Water
Your parents took you and your sister once to see Niagara Falls. It is the only true vacation you can remember, the only time you all sat in a car for hours on end. This was when your father was sick for a whole year, when the threat of mortality filled him with an expansive desire to see more of the world.
The station wagon moved like an injured insect, scuttling its way to the cold north. You sang songs, played I Spy, did all of the things they did in the movies when they went on road trips. You even asked, “are we there yet?” in tandem with your sister, giggling as though you were breaking some cardinal rule.
When you saw the falls themselves, you were underwhelmed, because the car ride, with its vomit&#45;inducing bumps and hours of too&#45;long roads, seemed so extraordinary that you expected to arrive somewhere else entirely, someplace like Oz or Rivendell.
It’s just water, you said. It’s just a lot of water.
7. Silence
You want to go back to the window. But every time you look over to that side of the room, you turn back to find your wife watching you with straining eyes
Normally, you are never quiet. This is a failing, an anxious tic that makes you fill the room with words. So now your silence, your nervous listening, arouses concern from your guests.
“Are you sure you’re okay?” they ask.
What you want is to say no, but what you want even more is to press your face against the cool glass and watch, strain at the dark spaces in the streets. Instead, you say yes, of course you’re okay.
But you can’t bring yourself to join in the talk, the discussion of movies and cartoons, even though someone has gotten on the subject of Starship Troopers and you have a lot of thoughts about Starship Troopers.
Right now, you can’t bear to add to the noise. The world has become loud, full of humming and scraping, and voices over all, so that you can barely hear the 12th chime of the bells in the distance as you check your watch and see it tick its way to 11:01.
8. Regrets
Here are some things you never did:
Go kite&#45;sailing. Beat Super Mario World. Learn an instrument. Learn a second language. You never stood up and fought for any noble cause—the only times in your life you did fight, you had been backed into a corner, forced by the aggression of others into lashing out.
You look at your wife. She is smiling and laughing. And what you fear regretting most of all, the thought that you can’t stand, is that she doesn’t understand the way you love her. It is not that you don’t tell her. The words have become so common between you that, at times, you find yourself saying them as a reaction more than as a thought.
Perhaps this is simple sentimentality. Perhaps you were not actually lying when you said you had one too many. It is possible that in your anxiety (you have been a wreck the whole night) you drank too quickly, refilled your glass too often without paying attention. But what you fear is that there is no sure way for her to know, to understand, the way you feel. The whole world is made of barriers—words, skin, skulls, and air.
You stand up, and you walk into the other room, the bedroom where the lights have not been turned on. She follows you.
“I just want you to know,” you say, and you are angry with yourself for still needing to use words, “I want you to know how much I love you, that I really really love you.”
“You’re being weird,” she says.
“I know,” you say. “But you have to understand.”
“Okay,” she tells you. “Just come back to the other room.”
You nod, and you begin to follow her, but you take a moment to step around the mattress on the floor, and you look out of the bedroom window. The streets are black, covered in moving shapes of different shades. You can make out nothing in particular, but the mass is jagged, frantic. You push your ear against the glass. And you swear that the mass had a voice, or rather many voices, clattering against one another like handfuls of stones dropped down dry wells.
You look back at the door, and your wife has already left you to rejoin the others in the light. 9. Stories
This is how it goes in stories: an ancient evil, a threat to life, to the world itself. A meek someone becomes a hero, saves the world, banishes the evil.
But if that’s how it goes in real life, you feel certain the hero isn’t you. You walk back into the small living room. You try to forget what you just saw—let’s not overstate it: what you think you saw. What you heard or what you thought you heard.
Your friends are playing Settlers, and your wife pats the cushion beside her, gives you a smile that is half “come on, have some fun,” and half “don’t you dare go crazy on me.”
You sit. You pick up the dice. You roll. You harvest some wheat.
You try desperately not to count the bells as they strike: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
And when you hear, when everyone hears, the frantic scratching on the apartment door, you say, with as much hope as you can manage, “I’m sure it’s just the wind.” " width="921" height="4091"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
