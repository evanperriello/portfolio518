    <h3 class="Main-Text">Living in a city like this can be hell. You never know when you’re going to be in line at the Super Mart, just looking down at your shoes, minding your own business, and in burst mind&#45;controlled ant&#45;people or yetis or genetically modified plant soldiers. And you just have to stand there, shaking in fear, shouting, “No, please! I have a son!” and hope that someone from the Justice Team gets there in time.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It’s not only the crime—I mean, after all, the heroes do always swoop in at the last possible minute, and aside from some underwear stains that do not come out (no matter what Clorox promises) and a good deal of shame, no harm done, you know? I could live with all of that.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But there are no jobs left for a guy like me. Last week, I went in for an interview at the Herald. And yeah, it’s been a few years since I’ve had a good gig, but I puffed myself up. I did what my life coach calls “proactive self&#45;realization.” I boned up on anything they might ask me about, re&#45;memorized the AP Style Guide, read books by Cronkite and Bernstein and Bartlett until their monotones filled my dreams. I devoured lists of potential interview questions, folded my clippings like pressed flowers.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It was one of those group interviews, so I sat in the waiting room, sizing up the competition, and I was starting to feel confident. I don’t mean to judge people—I’m not so perfect myself—but this was a prize crew. One guy was maybe twenty and was wearing shorts and flip&#45;flops, and the other must’ve been approaching sixty and just had this crazed look in his eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">So I figure I’m in, and I start to self&#45;realize paying off the mortgage, maybe buying that swing set little Danny’s always wanted. But then, a minute to interview time, in shoots a chisel&#45;jawed man with American&#45;flag&#45;blue eyes, walking at a speed that’s just that touch faster than normal, his hair slightly disheveled, as though he’s been in high winds. He winks at the receptionist, flashes perfect white teeth, and says “Sorry if I’m late. I got tied up,” which is probably this pun about the giant mutant octopus he just fought. And that’s it—back to the mailroom with me—everyone suddenly knows who’s getting the job of ace undercover reporter.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I was a teenager, I always expected my turn to come. I snooped around the old chemical plant, jumped back and forth over nuclear mine shafts, listened for signals from distant planets. I always thought I would be one of those weak&#45;armed nobodies with a full&#45;bloom of acne who turned into something great—a Spiderman or a Green Lantern, say. But instead, I turned out to be a weak&#45;armed nobody with only slightly less acne and a lot less hair.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It’s not that they’re bad guys, the superheroes. Don’t get me wrong. I mean, I of all people know that if it weren’t for them, I’d be in a pretty sorry state. I would have gotten my head melted by Señor Fuego two weeks ago at the Five and Dime.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It just makes it hard, you know, to think that you’ll never fly like they do. You’ll never have someone look up at you, late in the night, see your figure dashing across the moon like a small speck of gold and say to themselves, “God, isn’t that something?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I have friends, like Grey Falcon and the Red Veil, who didn’t leave things to chance, who made their own super suits or spent years in isolated monasteries training in the art of the Buddha’s palm, and now they’re up there on the rooftops with the rest of them.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But I was never good at math and science, and I am graceful only in the way manatees are graceful. I liked poetry and donuts in school.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The hardest thing is having a kid. It’s not just that Danny has to understand that his pop can’t beat up the other dads on the block. But I’ve got to watch him zooming around the back yard in his little red cape, and I think to myself, “No, probably not” because I know genetics are not in his favor. He’s not an alien or a robot; he’s not a mutant, as far as the in&#45;vitro tests could say. Unless he gets bitten by a radioactive eagle or zapped by cosmic rays, he’s staying right here, on the ground. And even if something does give the kid superpowers, then there I am, always worrying: have I raised him right?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The super villains have to come from somewhere, don’t they? There’s some other father out there right now, so proud imagining his son fighting crime, and instead his boy’s downtown melting bank vaults, laughing maniacally.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The other day in school, Danny wouldn’t share a toy, and I thought to myself, “maybe this is the sign, right here.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Sometimes I think I made a mistake, bringing Danny into the world. Because no matter what he does, he’s going to be like me—a supporting character, an extra on the sideline. So what do I do? Show him how to cower properly?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It’s no way for a man to live.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He could go into the police force or National Guard, try to make a difference. But then what? What’s really the point? Spend his days shooting at super villains so they can laugh off the bullets and prove how superior they are? Maybe drag them away after the Incredible Uber Mensch wraps a railroad tie around their torsos and say, “Time to close the lid on you, Jack&#45;In&#45;The&#45;Box?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t know. Maybe that’s enough.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Lucinda, my life coach, says my real problem is that I never accept the world for what it is. She says I need to learn to be happy with the small things, the moments of joy, and not try to create this cosmic tally wherein everything is either all good or all bad.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Lucinda is beautiful, and I’m kind of in love with her. But she’s got a boyfriend who can bench&#45;press a VW, and I know she’s nice to me mainly because I’m her meal ticket.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I told her that I liked her once, and she said that was just another manifestation of my problem, that I couldn’t just accept a friendship as a friendship—I had to have something more to make it worthwhile. I didn’t think that was entirely fair, but maybe she has a point.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Like, in our last session, she asked me what was something I’d done well that day, and I said I got through the whole incoming mail pile before lunch. And she looked at me with a big smile and said, “That’s great!”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I blushed and said it wasn’t anything, but she was so enthusiastic.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“That’s a kind of super power, isn’t it? Not everyone could do that.” She came over and rubbed my back. I looked up into her hazel eyes. “You never know. Maybe one of those letters was a tip for a member of the Justice Team, and they were able to save some lives because they got their mail early.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And I admit, I felt a little proud. Not a lot, but a little.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Maybe that’s all any of us need, to feel a little proud now and again.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The thing about Danny—he’s the most beautiful boy. I mean, he’s not going to be on any cereal boxes or TV ads or nothing, but the way he laughs, the way he runs and plays in the grass. I can just watch him for hours and think that life isn’t so bad, you know?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When my ex comes and picks him up for the weekend, it breaks my heart, every single time. I stop cooking—eat Spaghetti&#45;O’s from the can. Sometimes I just sit down at my desk and try to make myself keep breathing.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">This is something else Lucinda tells me, that I won’t be truly happy until I’m happy on my own, until I can fully realize myself as the person I want to be.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But she and I know I’m not the person I want to be. I never will become the person I want to be, barring a freak solar flare or meteor strike.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I want to jump over mountains, punch through brick walls. I want for Danny to look up at me and think his old man is the best in the world, at something, at anything.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">So I just keep waiting, wanting.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Lately, though, I’m trying. I started going to the gym twice a week, three times on the weeks when Sally has the boy. I walk to work. I do what I can.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I’m getting strong. I’m not going to pick up any Toyotas or anything. But last month, I squatted my body weight for the first time in my life. Can you believe that?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And yesterday, something happened. I was over at Tasty Swirl with Danny, and he was getting a Super&#45;Green Hulksicle, which is his favorite, because of the bubble&#45;gum eyes. And these two guys broke in with ski masks, started shouting “Everybody down on the ground!” and everyone around me is dropping, cowering, shouting “No, please!”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And I don’t know why—maybe it was because I knew the floor would be sticky from all that ice cream—but I just kept standing. I pushed Danny behind my legs, and I looked at one of the fellas, who had this big, nasty looking gun that he was waving around like it was on fire.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It was stupid, I know. I shouldn’t have done it.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He comes up to me, and he tells me to get down and sort of pushes me on the shoulder. And I say to him, because I don’t know what to say, I just say “You chose the wrong shop.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The guy stops and looks at me, and I can see he’s scanning my face, looking carefully at my jaw line and cheekbones. And I can tell he’s wondering if maybe he made a mistake, if maybe I’m some hero’s schlubby alter&#45;ego.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Which lasts about right up until the second he punches me, and I go down. Then he points the gun at me on the ground, and starts shouting, spit flying everywhere. “What? You think you’re some kind of hero?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Out of the bathroom steps this guy in a blue lycra bodysuit who says, “No, but I do,” and he makes short work of the thugs, gets his picture taken for the morning paper, all of that.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But the whole day, I couldn’t get it out of my head. I kept thinking to myself, “What would I have said if that hero hadn’t shown up, if it had just been the guys with the guns and me?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I haven’t told Lucinda about the whole thing, but I see her tomorrow, and she’ll have to ask—my jaw looks like a plum.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She’ll say I’m stupid, that I’m still wishing for things I’ll never have.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But maybe that’s all a guy like me can do.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For a second, I fooled that robber. Just for a second.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And that’s kind of like a super power, in a way.</h3>
