    <h3 class="Main-Text">We love Penny Lee in a way we can’t control.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She haunts us like cicada song, a humming on the edge of our hearing. It’s possible we loved her before we knew it, before we set eyes on her for the first time.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">There were those who tried to escape by moving away. But the thought of her grew stronger the harder they pulled. And they all came back with sharp&#45;hanging frowns, having found nothing in the world to get their minds off Penny Lee.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Then there were those of us who accepted our fate, who reigned in the scopes of our lives to a constant melancholy waiting.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I fell in love with her when I was twelve years old, in the forest past Cade’s Ridge, clutching a small wooden bow I had stolen from my father’s shed. I wanted to hunt, then, spent hours stalking the promise of deer.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;I heard a rustling behind an ivy bush five yards away, and I crouched down, rocked back into the pull of the string, and held my breath.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But a girl came out. A couple years older than me. Light brown hair that frayed and turned wheat at the tips from too much sun. Freckles that rushed up her cheeks and cupped her dark, brown eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">A basket full of wild strawberries and ginger dangled from the crook of her elbow. She looked up at me slowly, then parted her lips.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Keep pointing that at me. I’ll shove it up your ass.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I couldn’t speak. I pulled the bow upright and released its arrow straight into the tree tops. I didn’t see it or hear it fall. For years, I thought it might still be up there, hovering in a strange orbit.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She turned her back to me and walked away. It was only when she passed out of my sight that I could force myself to stand and start the long trundle back home.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I didn’t understand then that it was love, but my mind was full of her, cataloging every piece of the memory. I paid no attention to where I was going. I didn’t see a rusted trap covered in the slime of fallen leaves until it was clutching my ankle, until it had shattered my tibia and fibula into jagged little stones.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t remember screaming, though I must have screamed. I don’t remember being carried away by a hunter, the county judge, who happened to be nearby. All I remember is the long ride to the hospital in the back of a pickup truck. Staring at the pitch&#45;dark sky freckled with specks of white.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">We all loved her, but Penny Lee didn’t pay us any mind. It was like she was an actress who had walked onto the wrong stage. We played Romeo, but she was set on Joan of Arc.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And everything we did to impress her was so weak and foolish, like clapping at a thunderstorm. As she grew older, there wasn’t a man in town she couldn’t outrun, outspit, or outfight.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">With my leg ruined by bad luck and worse doctors, my father gave up on my prospects as a hunting partner and a football star and left me largely alone. I grew ashamed, avoided walking or running when I could.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I dug deep into stories and poems. I wrote letters for Penny Lee that I couldn’t bring myself to mail. And I practiced with my father’s old bow nightly. My mind tied the action of drawing it back to that first sighting.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I grew strong in my arms as my legs became weak. I could hit a dime&#45;sized target from a hundred yards away.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Then Penny Lee fell in love.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She was twenty&#45;two and had still shown no inclination to affection. Most of the other women in town hated her. And her admirers, men and women both, drew nothing from her but scorn. She was alone, seemed as though she would always be alone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The thought killed us. We tore our hair and beat our chests in moments of solitude, lying feverish and awake at dawn. To be bested by another would have been bad enough, but to be turned down in preference to nothing was an agony we couldn’t bear.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">So we were all a little glad when Odell came to town.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He was the son of a timber king who had made a fortune out west. But Odell didn’t have a penny in his pocket. Just a pack of tools and camping gear and a hunting bow as tall as he was. He was taking work where he could find it, seeing the country as he went.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He made fast friends. He was clever and had a story for every occasion. Curly black hair, a broad chin, and dark eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It didn’t take long for the boys to tell him about Penny Lee.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But Odell seemed uninterested. As soon as the talk turned to Penny Lee, he’d change the subject, pull us into a story to avoid the morbid rehashing of our ill&#45;fated love.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And though we urged him on, he made no effort to go to her end of town. “So I can become like you all, telling the same stories about the same girl? Thank you kindly, but no.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I was the one who finally convinced him. I told him that passing through this town without seeing Penny Lee would be missing a work of God’s art, a natural wonder like Yellowstone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I was there when he first saw her. He brought me along to smack him if he did anything stupid.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I should clarify what it was that made Penny Lee so haunting. I believe, though I cannot prove it as she never stood for pictures, that an image of her would be largely unexceptional. Yet there was a simple grace to everything she did, so that even taking out the trash became captivating.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And this is how we spotted her: hair pulled back in a handkerchief, shivering against the cold, a pail full of compost tucked under one arm.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I crouched in a nearby bush, but Odell, when he saw her, stood right up, looked straight into her eyes. “Howdy,” he said and waved.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She looked at him a second, seemed to size him up, then reared back and shot a wad of spit that landed on the top of his shoe.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Name’s Odell,” he shouted as she went back up the steps of her porch and slammed the door.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I see,” he said, “Yes, I think I do.” He wiped the tip of his shoe off on the grass. Then he turned for Mrs. Crawly’s place, where he was staying while he fixed her chicken coops.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I hobbled close behind him. Where my leg once was grew alive with pain.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">A couple weeks went by, and Odell refused to speak to us about Penny Lee any more. But we saw him walking down her street, casting his eyes about. He wasn’t looking at Penny Lee, didn’t notice when she came out of her house.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Instead, he examined the houses nearby. Found the clogged gutters and sinking porches, the garage doors that wouldn’t open and the siding that needed new paint. He’d offer to work for free in exchange for a spare bed and meals.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">By degrees, that street became the best&#45;maintained in the county. There wasn’t a patch of paint allowed to peel, a leaf left unraked.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t know when she started watching him from her windows, how many hours she spent scowling at his form before she began to regard him with indifference, and then with something more.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">All I know is that when he fell off her neighbor’s roof that November, fixing a leak that had sprung with the heavy autumn rains (a soft fall for two stories, one might even say skillful), she ran out of her house, swearing to Jesus like her back was on fire.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She scooped him up, tested him to see where he might be broken (nowhere it turned out, though perhaps a twisted ankle, a bruised rib—injuries that make it hard to move without aid), and she brought him inside to lay down on her couch.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t know what words they spoke then. I don’t know, in the end, how he finally won her love.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">They were married a year later. The whole town turned out: every one of her admirers hoping at the last moment she would throw off her veil and profess that she really loved us instead, had loved us all along.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But when her veil was lifted, there was no mistaking the look on her face, and we all swallowed our hearts as far down as they could go.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The wind was light and summery outside the church, though it carried brown and golden leaves. Our dreams of Penny Lee went into storage with all other dreams of childhood.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;I went to school up north, studied literature and began teaching. But the cold air didn’t suit me. I made attempts at love that sputtered and died. I was called uncaring, too distant.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I buried myself in my books and my work, and when old Mrs. Brackhurst the local high school English teacher passed away, I jumped on the chance to get back home. My parents, by then, had long&#45;since moved. But I found a small room near our old house, close enough to the woods that I could go out in the night and fire arrows into a rotten stump.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The town I found on my return was peaceful. Penny Lee had grown more sociable, would wave and say hello to us as she walked down the street, even smile (did she know then that these smiles still wracked us with pain?).</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Odell had been disowned by his lumber&#45;king father because he’d refused to move back west and had taken a job at the local army base instead.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I spoke with him often. It’s hard to find someone to talk books with in a town like this, and he was a voracious reader. He liked to quiz me in the late hours of the night about symbols and signs.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When the war started, Odell was moved to the front. We asked after him, but as the years went on, Penny Lee’s answers went from smiling assurances to harried, worried, and angry. We stopped asking, and word spread around town that he was M.I.A.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Eight years now he’s been gone. Penny Lee is older. We are all older. But her beauty hasn’t faded, and what tact there was for the widow of a missing soldier has gone by the wayside.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">We never stopped loving her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It was Wyatt Harris who first started up again. We would catch him walking down her street, a bundle of flowers under his arm, his finest grey suit on and a boater sunk low on his head. With his thinning hair and his gut six inches past his chest, he looked ridiculous, but this only furthered the sense of competition in the rest of us. By compare, we didn’t look so bad. We were richer, smarter, more handsome as we examined our figures in full&#45;length mirrors. We had good jobs. We bathed with relative frequency. We all, we thought, cleaned up pretty nice.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">So I watch from my window as lines of men saunter with banjos and guitars in&#45;hand to give her moonlit serenades. Witness the flabby&#45;armed flexing and the hourly fights that break out on street corners as she passes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The town has all but ground to a halt. And like a child who spots a deer, all these men have chased that which they most desire away. She doesn’t leave the house, except when she needs groceries (lord help the man who tries to carry them for her). Her smiles, her gentle waves, are gone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My leg has been aching again. I start up in bed with the sensation that blood is flowing back into it, turning the capillaries into small branches of fire after so many years.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It is three&#45;forty seven one Sunday morning when I hobble up to the kitchen sink, gulp water like a man dying of thirst and gaze out at the muddy black streets.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">A figure moves toward the house, cutting its way around the yellow circles of streetlights. Yet I know from the grace of its movements that it’s her. She stops at my porch, and I watch as a small square of white paper slips its way under the door. Then she is gone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The next day, I check the note every couple of minutes to assure myself it wasn’t a dream. But it is there, with a time (two a.m.) and her name, written in an elegant but shaken hand.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I call in sick to work and spend hour after hour pouring over the letters I’d written and never sent, reliving every moment of hope and despair.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I am haggard. My eyes are surrounded by pools of charcoal by the time one forty&#45;five rolls around, and I start the walk over to her house.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Odell always said you were a friend,” she tells me after hurrying me inside and sitting me down on her couch, “said you were the only man in this town with half a brain.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The inside of the house, like the outside, has suffered from Odell’s absence. In corners and stacked on chairs are piles of clothing and the detritus of daily life—papers and advertisements, bills and torn&#45;open envelopes from the Army. Her right hand moves in a feverish jitter on her left knee, as though she were putting out a cigarette butt again and again.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I’m tired,” she says, “I’m tired of living like this, holed up in here. But you see what they’re doing to me. Can’t even go down and buy grapefruit without the whole town singing at me like the god&#45;damned boys’ choir. But moving away wouldn’t do any good. Would drag half the town with me, the way those rednecks are.” She stops talking and looks at me. “And here I’m telling you this. You probably love me too, don’t you?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I must be turning as red as wine, because she waves a hand at me. “It’s alright. Good, I suppose. But darling, and I’m only going to say this to you once, and I’m not trying to be mean about it: I’m never going to love you. I’m sorry, but it’s true. I’ve had my love in this life, and he’s gone and disappeared. That doesn’t mean my heart’s stopped loving him. You understand?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I tell her that yes, actually, I understand that all too well. My heart is beating hard, and I try to focus on calming it down.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“But I’m hoping Odell was right. I’m hoping you’re a friend. Because I need you to help me out here. No one’s going to leave me be unless I marry again. But I think they might tear apart anyone who tries. Unless they feel they lost me fair and square.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“It’s a lot to ask,” she says, “It’s a hell of a lot to ask, and I wouldn’t bother except that Odell always said you were the kindest man he knew. And that’s what I’m counting on. So I need you to tell me what it is you’re good at, what you’re better at than any other man in this town.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The contest was announced in the next week’s paper, her letter taking up a good half of the front page. And everyone has come out, as early as possible, to a large clearing in the woods, not far from where I’d first seen her. The line, when I get there, is doubled back three times. Squinting, I can barely see the target she’s set up—so far away and half&#45;hidden by the branches of barren oaks, a dime hanging on a piece of fishing wire.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Odell’s old bow is there, right up front, and next to it, hundreds of arrows stuck in the ground.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I take my place, and an old man stands behind me. He has heavy, bushy brows that block his eyes and a back that’s curved to the point of snapping. He smells of countless miles and ages of weary walking. We are the infirmed two, the end of the line.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">With every draw of the string, I worry that someone will hit it. But even those who get closest are off by a yard at least. It is so far, an inhuman distance. And the bow is heavy. It will take all of my strength to draw, and most of the men can’t manage that. Still, each time one lifts it, I put a hand to my chest, to the pocket of my coat where I’ve hidden that bundle of letters.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I know she’ll never love me, but I’ve resolved to give them to her once this is done.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The day goes quickly. It is like watching the worst ride at an amusement park: the sickened, quavering men hobbling back past the line one&#45;by&#45;one. You can see hearts breaking as the arrows veer away and impale trees downfield, which look now like porcupines.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And soon I am standing next to the bow. Running my fingers across the fletching of the arrows to find the perfect one. I can’t bear to look over to where she’s standing.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I’ve promised her this. That I can do this. But as I knock the arrow, I’m afraid for the first time in my life.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I take off my false leg and sit back into a crouch, leaning into the pull of the bow. My whole body is a part of it, my arm out, across my good leg.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My heart slows. My lungs let out a smooth sigh. And I let go.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It is a perfect shot, and I watch the arc of the arrow approach the target slowly. But at the last second, a fierce gust of wind pushes the dime up and out of the way. The arrow passes right where the dime should have been, sinks itself deep into the limb of an oak.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I cannot stand, do not have the heart to reattach my leg. I feel the old man’s hand on my back. “Move along,” he says. “You had your turn.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Everyone who is still there turns away, preparing to go home. The contest is done for today, and nobody has won. But I am watching the dime, watching it flicker and shimmer in the air.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I am the only one to notice the old man as he straightens his back, as he pulls the string without a hint of struggle and takes careful aim. I am the only one to see the tip of the arrow strike Roosevelt’s silver nose, though everyone, every person in the whole town, must hear the metal ping and see the flash as the dime swings up and over the branch.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The old man stands triumphant, the bow clutched tight in his hands. His shoulders widen as he takes a deep breath. He pulls off the eyebrows and the beard from his face.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It is Odell, or what was once Odell, though still he looks old with his face laid bare. There are scars there and, I know, deeper hurts hidden within. His black eyes are no longer alive as they once were. Instead, they are full of fire and rage. He has become something different in the time he’s been gone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Usurpers!” he shouts. “Traitors and scum!” He reaches down for an arrow, knocks it and releases in one smooth movement, sending it spiraling into the sunken chest of Wyatt Harris.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Then another, and another. All around me, they are falling.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Eight years!” Odell shouts. “Eight years to find my way back. To a town of snakes!”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I scramble to run, and I look up to where Penny Lee is standing, as though she could stop it, could save me. And I see on her face, between the worry and the horror, something that looks a little like love.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But it is already too late. Too late for her to scream at him, for Odell to hear her or understand or care. Too late for all of us.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">We are doomed, have had our deaths marked down in the book of fate for years, millennia before we were born. And now, after so much waiting, they are finally here.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The arrows are on their way.</h3>
