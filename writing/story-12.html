    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I tell people this story, I say that I was adrift, so I washed up on a beach. It’s not far from the truth. I was fresh out of school, so I applied to whatever jobs I could find that didn’t require experience. I ended up working for the Parks Service in a temporary program. They paid me in food stamps and promises of forgiven student loans. They gave me a heavy olive coat and a flashlight and a radio.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It was my job to walk up and down a small beach on the coast of Maine in the winter, picking up stray bottles and cigarette butts, making sure no youngsters were up to nefarious deeds. This is what my manager called it: “nefarious deeds,” as though any small group of teenagers might be plotting the downfall of life, liberty, and the American way. What he meant was drinking, building bonfires, smoking pot.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But the whole thing was a moot point. It was a cold winter, and near the water it was coldest, so no one did much of anything, nefarious or otherwise. Occasionally, a couple of tourists would walk, huddled together just past the reach of the waves, pointing to clouds and ships on the horizon, taking photographs of the wind&#45;rippled sand.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">There was only one time when I saw a group of teenagers, and they didn’t stay long enough for me to report them. They pulled into the parking lot in a large red truck, hopped out and rushed down to the beach. There were five of them: two girls and three boys. Likely they were drunk and prone to nefarious deeds.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Two of the boys shouted at the third, egging him on, and the girls soon joined in. The third boy pulled off all but his underwear and dove into the sea, then burst out of the water, whooping and hollering.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The others were already running back to the truck by the time he trudged out of the water. They began to peel away, and the third boy ran with real fear, screaming at them to wait. They slowed down just long enough for him to jump into the bed of the truck. I could hear them laughing in the night.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I took the job, I thought the solitude would give me the time and space I needed to focus and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. But it wasn’t like that. Instead, the silence reinforced itself, made me uninterested in the demands of distant society.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I watched a lot of sunsets through sea fog. I grew used to the swooping and squawking of gulls trying to crack oysters in the sand. I kept track of the long brown grass that grew toward the beach to reclaim territory from the busy summer months and that bent and clacked in the wind.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I bought a small fish tank and two hermit crabs named Rosencranz and Guildenstern. In the evenings, with my flashlight, I scoured the shoreline for shells that were larger than the ones they already had. I fed them pieces of canned tuna and watched them scuttle around at night, leaving thin, zipper&#45;like lines in the sand.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One day, when I was sitting in the ranger’s station, watching Rosencranz and Guildenstern tear at either end of a strip of tuna, I saw a white spot on the shoreline at the end of my coast. I had given up on finding anything nefarious, but I thought perhaps something interesting had washed ashore. Occassionally, Noreasters would litter the ocean with white birch logs and broken boats, and I thought perhaps this was a far&#45;flung piece of flotsam.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I said goodbye to Rosencranz and Guildenstern and put on my coat and boots, checked the batteries in my Maglite and strolled down the shore.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">As I got closer, I saw that the shape was human, a woman about my age. She was sitting on the sand with her knees up against her chest and long, pale arms wrapped around her shins, her hands cradling her feet. She was dripping wet and wearing an old&#45;style swimsuit, a white one&#45;piece and a bathing cap</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Jesus,” I said, “Are you okay? What happened?” I took off my coat to offer it to her and felt the air bite into my skin.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“No,” she said, pushing the coat away, “I’m alright, don’t worry.” And she smiled at me. I could see she wasn’t shivering. “I’m Lumen,” she said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I told her my name, and I asked her what she was doing out there. I had seen no cars in the parking lot.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I live nearby,” she told me. “I like to come swimming on nights like this, when the sky is clear.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Even with my coat, I was cold, and I asked how she kept from freezing.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I’ve never felt the cold like other people do. One day, when my parents found me splashing in a frozen pond as a child, they took me to a doctor. He said that I had an extra layer of fat beneath my skin, thin but dense, like a goose has. It’s a genetic thing, an anomaly.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">As I looked closer, I could see that there was a certain softness to her features. The angles of her face seemed smoothed over, like those of a doll.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She looked out to the short waves, which were creeping up to her feet. “Swimming on nights like this makes me feel special, like a superhero, you know? Plus, I get the whole beach to myself.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“And you don’t feel it at all?”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She thought for a moment. “I do feel it. I can tell the difference between cold water and warm. But it doesn’t bother me. Never gets deeper than the skin.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She told me to sit down with her and asked me what I was doing there. I told her about the nefarious deeds I was supposed to prevent.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“And save damsels in distress?” she asked.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I told her that wasn’t technically part of my job.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Still,” she said, “good job on the whole jacket thing. If I weren’t a superhero, I’d really appreciate it, I’m sure.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“I’m glad you are,” I said, “Otherwise, I’d be freezing my ass off right now.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She asked me about myself. I told her all of the mistakes I had made—going to a good school but studying art instead of science, moving across the country just because it seemed nicer over here.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She said she felt much the same. She said she had never finished school, was likewise drifting. “Why do you think I need to feel like a superhero? The rest of my life is a shambles.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">By the time we finished talking that night, my face was numb from the cold, and I wasn’t sure that my limbs could move well enough to carry me back to the cabin. Even still, I only got up because Lumen wanted to go for another swim.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Care to join me?” she asked.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I laughed and said I couldn’t. I didn’t think I was a superhero like her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Okay,” she said, “but you never know until you try.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I had never seen someone so graceful in the water. The white dome of her swimming cap would burst up out of the waves and then dip down again a moment later before staying under for long stretches of time. She turned and raised one hand to wave goodbye from what seemed like miles of dark ocean, and I trudged back to the little cabin where I huddled in front of the space heater and felt the sting and itch of blood returning to my skin. Rosencranz and Guildenstern had eaten all of their tuna and were curled up inside their beautiful shells.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For the rest of that winter in the middle of the coldest nights, I would see Lumen appear on the shore, and I would trudge out to talk to her for hours as she sat between her swims. I never saw where she walked from or where she walked to afterward, as though she had appeared from and returned to the sea.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Perhaps it was a symptom of my solitude, but I felt a connection to her that only got stronger the more we spoke. She was funny and playful and smart. She spoke passionately about art and music, films, and books. And most of all, she seemed to share my hollow sadness.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">How to describe it, exactly?</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I had always preferred to be alone, and in the past when I thought I had fallen in love, I never quite managed to get rid of the tension that stemmed from being so near to someone else. With Lumen, it was different. She was the only woman I’d ever met with whom I could comfortably be alone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Every night, as we ended our talking, she would step into the freezing waters and ask me to join her, but I laughed and returned to my small cabin and my heater and Rosencranz and Guildenstern.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Eventually, she made me a promise. If I would swim with her, she would give me a kiss. Though I loved her terribly, and though I thought she loved me, we hadn’t yet said so.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When, the next night, I stripped off my coat and pants, and she saw that I had come dressed in a wetsuit, she laughed. “You’re such a wuss,” she said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“We mortals have to protect ourselves,” I said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Okay, I guess it will have to do,” she said, “come on then,” and she skipped out into the black waves.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The water was colder than I had imagined, and those parts of my skin uncovered by the suit became numb instantly. Even with the suit, the chill cut through my flesh, aching and making my lungs shiver.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I have always been a strong swimmer, but Lumen moved in the water as though she didn’t feel its weight. She lead me out as far as I would go, before I called to her and made her stop. I could barely see the beach, a Cheshire&#45;cat smile against the darkness of the ocean, and the light of the cabin like one winking eye.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Lumen swam back to me. I was breathless, tired, and cold, but she seemed like she could have gone on for miles yet. I couldn’t see her breath in the frosty air.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“About that kiss,” she said, and she came close to me, wrapped her arms around my chest while we treaded water to stay afloat. She opened her mouth slightly, and brought her lips to mine.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I felt her arms begin to squeeze me more tightly, to wrap tighter and tighter around my ribs. Then the squeezing became a crushing, pushing in my sides and driving her chest into mine. And with her mouth, she sucked my breath away. She pulled so close to me that there was no water between us. She wrapped her legs around mine, turning my kicking into short, frantic jerks. Together we fell beneath the waves, her pulling me with her, still and heavy like a cannonball. The world around me turned black.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I realized she wasn’t going to let go, panic set in. I struggled to get free. But every time I broke her grip, she latched back on and kept pulling me down.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I began to kick, to punch at the black water, at the emptiness where I thought she might be until all she held was my hand. I pushed my feet against her and pulled so hard that I heard my shoulder pop out of place, like a gun shot against the soft whoosh of my pulse.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The pain was fire. But I broke free.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">As I swam back to shore, I could feel her behind me, her long fingers reaching for my kicking feet.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I reached the shore, I threw up. Gallons of saltwater from my lungs along with everything else inside of me.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Looking back, I saw the dome of her cap sink beneath the waves and disappear.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When I got into the cabin, I couldn’t move. I shivered in front of the heater, watching Rosencranz and Guildenstern scuttle and search their tank with their strange, stalked eyes for any hint of food. It was nearly dawn before I picked up the radio and called for help.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I couldn’t tell the truth, of course. Partly because no one would believe it, and partly because the whole thing had gone so quickly and been so unexpected that I barely believed it myself. I said that I had gotten bored and gone swimming, that the waves had pushed me shoulder&#45;first into a rock on the shore. The dark purple bruises that spotted my arms and ribs seemed to bear this out for the doctors—that I had been battered by the sea.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I lost my job (due to suspected nefarious activities), my food stamps, my promises of forgiven student loans. I moved down to Boston, where I stayed with friends until I could find some retail work.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Whenever I got the chance, I went to the library, read back through the myths that had scared me as a child, macabre fairytales about shape&#45;shifting creatures that lure men to the water’s edge with their beauty, then pull them down below. The mermaid, the nix, the kelpie, the kappa. Every culture has its own.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For a year, I lived in the uncertainty of my dream. But my shoulder still ached. That December I took a week off work and returned to the shore. Every night, I walked up and down the coastline, near to the long grass so that she wouldn’t see me before I saw her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Three days I walked with no luck, no sighting, but then on the fourth, I saw her in the moonlight. She had taken off the bathing cap, and her dark hair flowed down her back like a shadowed mane. She sat there watching the sky and the waves, patient, like a sentinel, waiting for someone to happen by—my replacement, perhaps, in the small cabin. Her features were sharper now. But there could be no doubt that it was her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Seeing her chilled me, and though I had considered confronting her then, I found I couldn’t move. For hours I watched her sit in the pale light, lean back with her palms in the sand and let the dark water lap at her toes, until the sun peeked over the horizon, and she stood up, brushed herself off, and dove back into the water where she disappeared.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The next night, I couldn’t bring myself to go back. Nor the next. And when I returned on the final night of my stay, the beach was empty, just the tall grass and the shadows and the waves.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">This should be the end of the story, I know. A cautionary tale, a near&#45;miss. But it’s not.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It has been twenty&#45;three years since I first met her. I have gone from a shiftless twenty&#45;something to a shiftless forty&#45;something. Every year I go back and watch her there. While my body has grown older and soft (I have lost the ability and the will to swim), she hasn’t aged. But each time she is different, just slightly. Sometimes her face is fuller, sometimes gaunt. Sometimes her eyes become large and pale, sometimes so dark that they don’t show in the shadows. Her skin, too, and her hair. Every time she is beautiful, but beautiful in a different way.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">In twenty&#45;three years, I haven’t found anyone like her, anyone with whom I can talk so easily, with whom I would share a frosted pile of sand for hours on end. I have tried to fall in love in many ways. But each time I am only reaffirmed in my antipathy and strangeness.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It bothers me, of course, to think this. I’m aware that every word, every gesture and laugh that we shared was likely a ruse, a simple flicking of the lure before reeling me in. It’s possible that she knew nothing of the books and art she claimed to love, or that she had studied them just in case she met a man like me.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">There must be a lot of men like me: studious, solitary, unfit for true human kinship. And if anyone is going to walk on a beach in the winter, we are the likely ones. We are the fish that leap in the boat at the merest motion, the slightest hint of human affection.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But I wonder sometimes. Because though I know what she is, what she wanted from me, I still love her in a way. I was still happiest on that cold beach, sitting beside her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It is foolishness, I know. But if I can ever speak to her again, if I can bring myself to walk up to her and hear her voice, and if she doesn’t swim away from me, I think I will tell her that I’m ready to go with her, that I’m no longer content to be the one that got away. And this time, she won’t have to trick me, won’t have to force me down with her. She can simply hold my hand and kick alongside me, carry me beneath the thick black waves.</h3>
