    <h3 class="Main-Text">I once knew a man who made coffee for his dead wife.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He lived in the apartment next door to me. I was young and in love and in staggering amounts of debt.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">There was only one sink in the building’s shared kitchen, and I often rose early with anxious stomach pains, so I saw him fill the pot every day and take it back to his room. I smelled the coffee brewing. And then, a few hours later, when the smell had gone stale, he would pour the whole pot back into the sink. He never rinsed, so that there was a light brown circle that covered the bottom of the basin.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My fiancée lived far away then, in another country.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For a whole year my body ate itself, devoured cell by cell the linings of my stomach and my brain. Going too long without a hug can kill you. The human body can live without sex, without kissing. But contact is a necessity, like water or food. The spine bends into a novelty straw. The ears ring. The stomach digests nothing but sugar and grease.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I had met the old man’s wife when I first moved into the building. She was delicate, and she moved upstairs as though climbing a mountain. She wore elegant dresses and flower&#45;laden hats, and her knees shook when she stood in one place too long.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She died sitting on a park bench nearby. Her brain filled with blood, and she sank into a short hunch, propped up for hours before a breeze blew her hollow body into the path of passing joggers.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I heard the old man sob, then punch the walls. They were gossamer thin, and I felt certain he would break through to my side.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One day, months later, as he got ready to pour the coffee out, I asked if I could have a cup. He nodded and filled my chipped yellow mug. The coffee was cold, and far too strong (I imagine his wife had made it herself when she was alive). But I hated to watch it go to waste.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The next day, he offered me a cup when it was still hot. From then on, I kept the old man and his wife’s ghost company in the morning.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He was a behemoth. If his bones had thinned from age, they must have started as rail ties. And I could tell, from patches of weathered skin that still showed scars, and from the way his nose sat on his face, as though scared of his left eye, that he had at one time been a man of great violence.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Mostly we read the paper together, seated at his steel and laminate dining table. I snatched up the sections of the Times that he put down, the sections that must at one time have been hers: Arts and Entertainment, Style, the Sunday Book Review. Then I would circle back to the front page, Business and Sports. I grew to like reading the paper this way. It made the world kinder.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">In the evenings, I waited tables at a dive on the banks of the Hudson. Then I came back and sat anxiously by my computer to catch my fiancée when she awoke. I averaged four hours of sleep. Days I stumbled around the city or hunched at my desk and pretended to write. But the only things I have to show from that time are hundreds of emails to her—long and rambling, fragile and straining at things that don’t belong in words.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">If you want to become a writer, love someone far away.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The old man, whose name was Besnik, was a champion laconic. Most days all that passed between us were pleasant hellos and goodbyes, the rustling of paper. I made the mistake, at first, of asking questions and making remarks on the apartment—the carved cherry sideboard, wallpaper the color of eggnog, the black and white photos of children with dour faces and crooked teeth.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Besnik would fold down the top of his paper with a flick of the wrist, look at me for a moment, and say “yes” or “no” or “I do not know,” then flick his paper back into position. It was as though this space had grown around him slowly without his will or his attention.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I tried to tell him about my life. But my stories garnered either shrugs or single lines of advice, followed by the raising of his paper wall. It was not that the advice was wrong. But it came from a world with no middle course, no room for deliberation, and this gave it a frustrating zen&#45;like simplicity.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Work is work. Money is money. Love is love. Life is life.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Over the course of that year, I collected the following information: They had lived there for ten years. She had been a nurse. Coffee did not agree with him, but he liked the smell. He came from the old country, never mind which one, but she was from the new country. They had fallen in love. He had followed her here.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The past is the past.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One morning, our apartment building was broken into. This was not surprising—often I had left my key at work and had forced the front door myself. It required little more than a push. But I had never been robbed before, and I did not take it well.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The robber was young, and he shivered in his heavy coat. His face was pale and covered in bright red scabs, and his teeth hung limp within their gums.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He had a silver revolver, which he pushed at us, as though it were a knife.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">My apartment was closer to the front door, so he robbed me first, pocketing my broken MP3 player, tucking my laptop into his bag.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When the robber pointed the pistol at him, Besnik got up calmly, went to his wallet on the dresser and pulled out what cash he had—perhaps twenty or thirty dollars.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But then the man began to grab at all that was around him—old candlesticks and photo frames, a small silver brooch that sat on the dresser.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Besnik pulled the gun from the man’s hand slowly, like a parent taking a toy from an unwilling toddler, brought him to the ground, and began slamming his fists into the man’s face, one after the other, like a baker punching dough.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;“You should not be touching her things,” he said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I don’t know why I tried to stop him, except perhaps that I knew if I didn’t he would kill the man, and I was not ready to see someone die. But Besnik pulled me down so that I lay next to the robber, so that I saw beside me the bloodied face, the eyes swollen and barely human.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He held me there for a moment, then he pushed me away and got up off the other man.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I heard the robber banging into walls as he ran away. My laptop, no doubt broken, was still in his bag.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Besnik washed his hands, emptied the bullets from the gun, then picked up the coffee pot and went out to fill it.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">That afternoon, I called a locksmith and had him install a deadbolt on the door. But for weeks, I was afraid. And this worry overwhelmed all the others. I pictured the robber coming back for revenge. I imagined him lighting the building on fire, Besnik and I rushing to the rickety iron escape out back and falling to our deaths.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Nothing like that ever happened. But the robbery changed things for me. Until then, I had pictured my situation as romantic in its misery. Compounded by the fact that I could no longer speak to my fiancé except through emails written in 10&#45;minute time blocks at the library, the worry overtook me, and I started looking for an escape.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I grew weary of reading, grew tired and fearful of the city. Its excitements turned ugly.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When my lease ran out, I quit my job and moved back in with my parents in Arizona. I had nothing to show for my time in New York. All the cheap furniture, the posters that hung on my walls, I left there and flew with only one small case full of books and clothes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">On my last day in that apartment, I sat with Besnik for his morning coffee. I told him I was leaving.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He said nothing.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When the coffee grew cold and I stood up, I put a hand on his back. “Thank you,” I said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He took in a deep breath that turned his arched back into a wide, flat expanse.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">A year later, I came back to the city to visit a friend, and I went to my old apartment. But Besnik’s name was no longer beside the buzzer. I felt certain that he wouldn’t have left that place.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I went to the library to search through the Times obituaries. He was there. Survived by no one, remembered perhaps, by no one but me. And even I knew so little that the few lines devoted to him were revelations.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He had already been old, his children nearly grown, when he lost his family in Kosovo. His second wife had nursed him over months as a volunteer with the Red Cross, then had taken him like a wounded bird back to the place where she lived, the beaten down apartment building that we shared.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">This is all I know, all I can find. Only the barest bones of their love story.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">I have often felt ashamed at leaving him alone there, of my cowardice and callousness. I have wondered if I might have said something else, if he would have told me his story if only I’d asked the right questions, if I had spoken more to his wife while she was alive.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But though it haunts me when I am maudlin and over&#45;sentimental, when I have a drink or two too many after a long night, there are enough joys in my life. My wife is here now, and she holds me, unthinking, in her sleep. And the days that seemed so difficult then are so simple, falling one after the other like dominoes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">In my better moments, I imagine Besnik sitting there alone with a pot of cold coffee, looking at the walls, content in the way only idols are content and wise. He is staring at me, his worn skin hanging about his crisp dark eyes, and he is teaching me all that I need to know.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Love is love. Life is life. The past is the past.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;</h3>
