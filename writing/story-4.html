   <img class="colelem" id="u353-74" src="images/u353-74.png" alt="Prologue:
In San Jose, there is a labrynthine mansion with hundreds of rooms. The woman who built it was convinced that ghosts were after her, that they had killed her husband and her baby girl. Her husband was a gun&#45;maker, creator of the Winchester repeating rifle—a gun that made a lot of ghosts and a lot of money. The woman took the money, and she tried to hide from the ghosts. She thought that if she lived in a house that was always changing, the ghosts wouldn’t be able to find her. She hired work crews to build around the clock: stairways that led nowhere, doors that opened onto walls. The work went on for 38 years, until the woman’s death in 1922.
All of that is true. The house exists. You can see it yourself. What follows is a story. It is not true at all. Every Sunday, the Widow calls to me from the fourth floor, and I work my way up the twisting back stairs, placing my hands on my thighs to help my aching knees. She tells me her plans, says the spirits need a new bathroom or a porch off the twenty&#45;second sitting room. She asks me for impossible additions. But I have learned how to persuade her, how to say, “They must want a half&#45;bath,” or “they’ll be wanting a new girder in here, so’s the roof won’t sag.” It’s easy enough to make the spirits say what they ought to have said.
Thirty years I’ve worked on this house. I was practically a boy when I joined the crew, hungry and poor. No more than an extra set of hands, but I could swing a hammer, and I could draw a straight line. And when the Widow spoke of her spirits, I was the one who wouldn’t smirk or roll his eyes. Never spoke behind her back, neither. If my father taught me nothing else, he taught me the value of silence.
I wasn’t too proud, like some of the others. O’Leary quit after she made him wall up a window of Tiffany glass. You could see his heart breaking, and his bald head got so red I thought he’d burn the place down.
All the old builders left or were fired, got injured or died. Now I’m the one the Widow calls to from her tower window when she doesn’t like the way an angle is looking or when she gets afraid that the path to her bedroom is too straight.
She has grown old over the years. I have found her lately in her study, coughing so hard that I can hear the blood in her lungs. Her eyes are still bright blue pools of hope and fear, but her body has shrunk around them, has turned inward and away from the black veils and dresses she wears. Her skeleton is sharp, and it pokes its way out against her skin—no meat, no blood to hide it. Behind every living thing is a dead one waiting to get out.
My wife Lorelei doesn’t like my work here. She says the place is cursed, that I bring home bad omens. Those bad omens pay the bills, I say. They buy new coats in the winter and re&#45;heel her shoes when they get worn down.
She blames the spirits for our son, taken from us ten years ago by the Spanish flu. I caught it as well, and my mind tore at me with horrible images. But my body was strong, while Nathaniel was only seven. We buried him by the orange groves where he used to climb.
I was gone from work then for nearly a month—the most time I’ve ever spent away from the house. When I returned, the Widow called me up to her chamber—it was on the seventh floor back then, before the earthquakes that left half the building in ruin. She had me sit on one of her plush chairs, and she poured me a cup of tea with her shaking white hand.
“You calm the spirits here,” she said. “It’s been hard without you. They have been wailing.”
When she talks about the spirits, her back arches, her breath gets deeper, as though they were filling her up. “You are a part of this place.” She fixed me with her bright blue eye. “I need you to be a part of this place. Will you stay?”
I promised her then that I would.
And she’s right, must be right, that I’m bound to this place. My roots are so deep here that I can hardly walk. I don’t believe in the spirits in the way that she does. But there’s something I’ve never told the Widow: if the spirits are there, then my father is with the rest, wandering these halls, looking for Winchester blood.
He was a creature built for war. Slew five dozen men from Antietam down to Jackson. Carried two bullets in his chest, one of which pressed on his lungs and made him cough when he yelled. But his long&#45;fingered hands never shook. I used to marvel at those hands. Now, after so many years, they’re my own. I drive nails as straight as he shot.
My mother passed while giving birth to me, and my father raised me in a dark mood. When he taught me anything, he kept a stick in his unmoving palm. And if I disobeyed him, a devil took him by the throat.
Once when I was young, I hid a fox pup in our shed to keep as a pet. But my father heard its hungry yaps. He tied it in a grain sack. Then he brought me to the stream on the edge of our land. When I said I wouldn’t drown it, he carried me into the depths and held me under as I kicked and pushed and punched at where I knew the bullets had struck him. He held me til the water filled my eyes and turned them black.
I woke on the muddy ground, the fox’s small body limp in the bag by my side.
I wanted nothing so much as to be a ghost then. Silence was peace, order and safety. I read what books I could find, drew pictures to keep my mind and hands busy. But silence doesn’t come natural to a boy. He broke both my arms and a leg, any number of ribs. I had so many bruises most days you couldn’t tell if I was black or white.
Then I fell in love.
I saw her swimming with her sisters in the lake, white cloth billowing up around her like angel’s wings. I sang her love songs and read her poems. I drew pictures for her of foxes and blossoms and deer in long grass.
I began to sneak away, jumped out of the rotting window frame, ran silent in the woods. But my father was too clever, had made his life hunting.
He found us huddled in a bush of sage. He beat me so well my skin went hard as stone. Then he dragged me back through every bramble and patch of ivy he could find.
Three days I couldn’t move from the bed. He’d come in, pour water down my throat and start to read to me from the Bible, about Adam and Eve, Samson and Delilah, the whore of Babylon. He had a poet’s voice, deep and sonorous and slow.
Once I could walk again, I went to his room and pulled his old rifle from the wall, its stock still stained red with Yankee blood. I loaded it full, making the metallic click as quiet as I could.
I found him on the porch, facing the front door, leaning back against the rough pine column. The early morning air was cool, and I could hear the sharp whipping sound of a cardinal’s breath. My father watched me raise the rifle to my shoulder, and he didn’t move, didn’t speak, didn’t even put up one of those solid hands to block me.
I added all sixteen rounds to the two already pushing against his lungs. Still, he didn’t fall, didn’t hardly seem to move. But there was a blank look in his eyes. His mouth lost its tense grimace. I left him there, still leaning against that post in his Stetson. And as I looked back, running through the field before our house, I could almost convince myself he was still alive.
Lorelei and I ran. Found out you can run almost to the edge of the earth without a dime in your pocket. We rode box cars with the old soldiers and slaves, thieves and prospectors, the whole host of humanity who had managed to believe that elsewhere was better than where they were, no matter where that elsewhere might be.
California seemed like a place without ghosts. But we carried them with us. We brought them all out into the new country, mixed them with the dead here. The place is rotten with them now.
Sometimes I think the Widow has the right idea, that you can’t run but maybe you can hide, if you keep making the hiding place darker, adding more twists.
I always keep the blueprints in my pocket with the main pathways drawn through the house and notes on each room—where the chandelier is, the glass window behind a wall, the bathrooms that aren’t hooked up to anything. But sometimes, though I built the house myself, I lose my way, and instead of pulling out the plans, I’ll close my eyes and spin around. Thirteen times—for the Widow’s sake.
When I open them back up, it’s a whole new place. The rooms and doors slow their swirling. I try to find my way, like a spirit looking for something, something I’ve sought across mountains and plains. I walk through room after room, go up and down stairs, and I think every time I open a door that I might find something behind it: a boy clutching an orange with sweat on his brow, a portly gunsmith with blood on his handkerchief, or an old man frowning with steady, long&#45;fingered hands.
I grow tired and nervous, weary in my skin, my aching joints. I sit somewhere, anywhere to catch my breath, and I feel a heavy weight on my chest, one that says there is nowhere to go, nothing to be found. I feel a part of them: the thousands of spirits caught up in this place. The dead and the dying and the yet to live.
