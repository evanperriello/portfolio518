    <p class="Title" id="u840-2">Narcissus</p>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Narcissus gazes into the pond. He is hungry. He is cold. His cheeks have become taut like drum heads. His eyes are rheumy, and he is plagued by the sharp spots of light that turn into shadows and flit away as he moves his eyes but that still come between him and the image.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He can smell himself, the ruin of his own body. He knows he has been here at the edge of the pond for days, has strained three, maybe four times to keep looking at the image through stygian nights. And yet, he hasn’t moved. So he knows that he is festering, covered in his own filth. But he is captivated by this face that stares back at him, so intently and fearfully with its wet, brown eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">This is what they’ll say: that the goddess tricked him, made him fall in love with his own image, fooled him into mistaking it for someone else: another youth with sharp features and an arrow&#45;straight brow. And it’s true that all of his life he has loved those most like himself, those foolish and too sure, those who spend their days preening and flaunting the gifts of their youth, who run and compete only to sculpt themselves into some nearness of perfection.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But the truth is he hasn’t been tricked. Or if he has, he’s aware of the trickery. He knows that it’s his reflection. He recognizes his own face.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And it is not love. It is something stronger. An infatuation, a frenzy.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Because, for the first time, he can read it.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">If he looks carefully, concentrates hard enough, and if the water remains still—no waves, no ripples, no wind—as it does now and again—he can read his own face.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He has never noticed before how sharp are the lines in his eyes, the red tendrils of Zeus’s lightning. And his muddy complexion, still marked and swirled by Prometheus’ thumb, and the way that when he breathes there is a hint of honeyed wine, ever so slight, from Athena’s lungs.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;But more than that. He can see worlds.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">In the pitch center of the eyes, he sees the nothing, the reaching eons of blackness before the world, before the titans and time. And then a small band of silver, an explosion, the start of everything hurtling outward, into stars and planets and dust and stone, into bodies and the bloody lifedeath of all the creatures who came before man.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">His own story too. Every strand of hair, curled and twisted like a willow’s branches, turned dark amber by the blood his fathers and mothers spilled. His people were horsemen, killers and thieves, before they became lords and ladies, before they were said to be Gods themselves.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He can see his father, born on the plains of Boeotia by the wide river, raised with a sword and reins in&#45;hand. And his mother, beautiful, stolen in one of countless battles, who cried for a whole year before he was born and then held him, stroked his soft, new face every night as she held him in her lap, told him that he was the only thing in the world.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He can see the impression of that small hand on his cheeks, even now that the skin has grown so gaunt.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He can peel back the layers of blazing sun that have gilded his flesh, the summers spent running with horses in the fields, catching their long manes and leaping, pulling himself up to their warm, wide backs. He can take away the cups of sweet wine that have stained, so slightly, the arch of his lips.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He can see something that he never before considered: the pale shade that sits inside him, and it is like the eager boy who used to run before his parents on their way back from the market. He would cut through the edge of the forest, the wind lifting his hair and screaming in his ears as he dove through the trees, to stand by the river’s edge. Calling, to something, someone.&nbsp; The child straining in the distance to see a lone boatman, weary at his oar. Holding in his hand a disk, a single coin. And crying out to the battering wind, “Take me home.”</h3>
    <p class="Title" id="u840-34">Arachne</p>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Her parents had no home. They made their livings picking grapes, lacing their fingers into the vines and pulling out the bright red orbs. All they owned were their clothes, and they wore them until the river&#45;rocks tore gashes in their sides. So her mother taught her to weave, and then to sew.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She became obsessed with the feel, the tension of string hugging string in the crooks of her fingers. She bartered for and stole what she could not afford. And with her own hands, she made herself beautiful. She twisted the long black strands of her hair into intricate ropes, made clothing so light that it shimmered like waves on the shore.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She worked in the night as she slept, so that the strands became invisible and her body worked by feel alone. And in the mornings, she woke to find marvelous tapestries of gold and silver and blue.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She became convinced that there was nothing she could not create.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">She grew wealthy. She grew old.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One day, a beggar woman asked about her art. Certainly she was skilled, the woman said. She must be grateful to Athena, from whom all wisdom and weaving springs.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Arachne looked carefully at the beggar’s face, shaded by the hood of a tattered robe. And there, in the shadows, saw the bright grey eyes of the goddess, their ancient fury and gleam.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">No, she said, I owe the goddess nothing. I have done this all on my own. I would put these hands against hers, if only she would challenge me.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The goddess stripped off her robe and her armor, unbuckled the gorgon’s head shield from her back and cast it to the ground like so much needless weight. Arachne watched her fingers take up the strands of the loom like chariot reigns.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For eight days and nights they worked. Eight times Arachne closed her eyes and slept, but kept her fingers moving, feeling the difference in color by the thickness and rigidity of their dyes—the dark red heft of beetle’s blood, the smooth, stiff purple of muscle’s shells, and the airy gold of onionskins.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">On the ninth morning, she woke to see the goddesses’ work. All the gods of Olympus ranged in their finest, from Zeus in his silver clouds to Poseidon straddling the wine&#45;dark sea. And there, Athena herself, in glimmering gold, holding her shield in the midst of battle to the pitch black spears of monsters and men.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Arachne unraveled her own work. And the goddess stood still for a long moment. There was Zeus as a bull, as a swan, so real that you could count the feathers, see them shudder in the wind. Venus and Ares drunk and entangled in her husband’s bed, the other gods laughing at their shame. Prometheus’ side torn open, as though you might reach in and feel the warmth of his blood. Every imperfection. Every breathing, bleeding scene of Heaven’s folly, from the moment Cronos called out in the void.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The goddess screamed with fury and tore Arachne’s world, her long nails like daggers in the thin fabric. She pulled it into eight long strips, then cast them to the edges of the room and disappeared.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Alone again, Arachne cried. The strips of the tapestry were lifeless and cold, their scenes meaningless separated one from the other. So she tied them together into a long rope and placed them around her neck.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When she woke from death, she found her fingers moving, twisting slick threads so fine that they floated, and she had to catch them back before they could escape, with second hands, third, and fourth. Like crystal, like diamond, like cloud and air. And in the mornings, her weavings caught dew drops, bright spheres that reflected the whole of heaven, and the whole of earth.</h3>
    <p class="Title" id="u840-66">Chiron</p>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Shining, laughing Apollo swooped down and caught him in the grass when he was only a foal. The other centaurs galloped after him, but the god’s feet were too fast for their hooves. He watched his family slip away, become small brown patches in the midst of grassy plains, their hands reaching up, up, to the heavens that grew dark as the god continued to climb. “You will be the father of heroes,” Apollo told him, “though none shall be your sons.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">From that moment, he was alone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The god left him at the base of Mount Pelion, took him to the edge of that hooked beach and showed him a cave so deep that it echoed with the sound of Hephaestus’ hammer. In the evening’s, when Apollo had finished his trips across the sky, he would stop his flaming chariot for a moment at Chiron’s door and gift the centaur with lessons in his arts: archery, medicine, music, hunting, and prophecy.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Chiron spent his time hunting in the hills nearby and repeating to himself the lessons Apollo had given him. How to draw the bow without stopping, how to channel your movement into power, how to release at the moment between footfalls, when the air lifts you in your stride. He studied all the forms of nature, stole unwanted corpses from battlefields to learn the inner workings of the bodies of men. He swallowed the leaves of poisonous plants and drank the venoms of snakes, steering clear only of hydra’s blood, which has the power to kill even immortals. And in the evenings, he played a whale&#45;bone harp and closed his eyes to see times that had not yet come.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">On the other side of the mountain was the land where he was born, where the wild centaurs trampled long grass in the sun. He called out to them once, but they laughed and snorted at his clothes, his kempt mane, his wide, oak bow like the bows of men. They encircled him, drumming their hooves on the ground, throwing rocks and branches until finally he trotted back to his cave.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">As the villages of men became larger, grew into towns and kingdoms, they called him wise. They asked his advice, and they gave him their sons to tutor and train in all the arts of the sun god. He taught countless heroes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Each of them left and completed great deeds. And again he was alone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One day, while he was training King Peleus’ son, brave Achilles who was then just a boy but already threw spears as far and fast as arrows, his old student Hercules came to the cave. The half&#45;god hugged him and lifted him from the ground, and Chiron laughed.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For all his efforts, Chiron had never taught the great hero wisdom, had never tempered Hercules’ fierce and deadly rages. But he was glad to see the young man, who was battered and bloodied from his battles. Hercules told him of strangling the Nemean Lion and showed him the bloody pelt that he wore on his broad back. He then produced a large glass vial, swished its contents, which glowed like burning emerald. “Hydra’s blood,” he said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Chiron invited his old friend to dinner and sent Achilles out to slay a deer.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">While the boy was gone, they walked and spoke. Their long strides carried them up to the top of the mountain and down its other side. The air was crisp with winter’s touch.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">His student asked him earnest questions—how best to capture the Erymanthian Boar or clean the Augean stables. They spoke so long that they did not notice the flattened grass, the droppings, the trees limbs torn down to be used as clubs. They did not hear the quiet hooves that followed them into the field.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When the first centaur jumped from the brush, Hercules caught him in the air and cast him into the sea like a stone. He then pulled the bow from his back and opened the vial of Hydra’s blood, spreading its venom over the tips of his arrows. In the half&#45;god’s rage, Chiron’s shouts couldn’t reach him, couldn’t be heard.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The hero’s arrows flew into the dark and the grass as he ran, as he balanced his shots, let go at the top of his stride the way Chiron had always taught him. They found their marks in the hearts and haunches of Chiron’s lost brothers and sisters, the wild creatures that snorted and stamped their hooves as they tried to escape.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And before he reached out his hand to catch the hero’s arm, Chiron saw all that would happen. He saw the half&#45;god turn and draw his bow, saw the drop of venom on the arrow’s tip reflected in Hercules’ open, blood&#45;red eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But beyond, beyond, he saw the boy Achilles fall in battle, lamented by the gods, and the sacking of the golden city of Illium in his glorious name.&nbsp; And he saw the body of Hercules, poisoned by the same Hydra’s blood, the creature that only he could kill and that, in time, found its revenge. He saw all the humans he had trained made bloody and broken, the smiting of Asclepius, Perseus falling from the heavens, and Actaeon torn by the teeth of his own loyal hounds.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">And Chiron said, looking at the arrows that had killed his kin, “What a small thing to cause so much death.”</h3>
