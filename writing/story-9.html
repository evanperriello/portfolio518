    <h3 class="Main-Text">The first time, they removed three ounces of the dark liquid from Rosen’s abdomen.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For four months he had been having the dreams. The night after his appointment, they got better, less fitful. And the pain in his right side became a dull ache, constant but so slight that he often forgot it was there.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The second time, there was more liquid. It filled the sample cup on the doctor’s tray and spilled onto the floor.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">They installed a small plastic valve, like a sugaring stile, just to the right of his navel. It folded up against his skin, but sometimes his hand would brush it as he showered or when he reached to scratch an itch, and it would trigger an acute discomfort, a feeling like an electric humming beneath his skin. At the doctor’s office, they hooked it up to a rubber tube and showed him how to empty the fluid himself. At home, he would stand above the toilet, letting the last drips fall before removing the tube and rinsing it out. He would flush and watch as the liquid clung together, stretched, and snaked down into the pipes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The dreams were what really bothered him, that and the confused, somewhat accusatory manner the doctors took with him. They didn’t know where the liquid was coming from or even where in the body it was being produced. And he sometimes had the feeling that they thought he was a fake, as though he were swallowing crude oil just to get attention.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">But it wasn’t oil. It wasn’t anything they could identify.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It became an everyday need. He would wake up hours before his alarm went off and shamble to the bathroom, pee, then empty the liquid, flush, and try to go back to sleep. The dreams would still be in his head. He had removed all sources of shadows from around the bed so that he wouldn’t be startled in the night.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Still, he almost never got back to sleep. He watched the white corners of his room turn golden with sun, listened carefully to the screeching of blue jays in the trees.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">At work, he was just waiting to be fired. He had, at one time, been a good accountant. But worry and tiredness made him sloppy. He had recently put a period in the wrong place and nearly cost a client ten thousand dollars. He was ignoring calls from the IRS.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Every evening, he went to a noodle shop on the corner of State and Main. It was a tiny place, cramped, with uncomfortable chairs that felt like they would fall apart, so no one ate inside except for him. He ordered the same thing for each dinner, a bowl of spicy broth with vegetables, pieces of seafood, and long rice noodles that felt like rubber against his tongue.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The shop was owned by a Chinese woman and her husband, a white guy from Brooklyn. Rosen enjoyed watching them. They argued the way that children argue, picking up every word and turning it against each other. And they would appeal to Rosen, as though he were their judge or their audience. “Do you see what she does to me? Now you know why I’m balding.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“Someday I’ll get a real man. Then I won’t work so hard. You tell him how lucky he is.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One night, Rosen came in and the woman wasn’t there. Her husband said she was out of town, visiting family. “You must be relieved,” Rosen said.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The husband looked at him: “I feel like I’ve been torn in half.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Rosen ate in silence. He didn’t go back for a week, by which time the woman had returned and the husband was back to complaining about her.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When he was a child, Rosen killed birds with a slingshot his father gave him. Mostly pigeons, but sometimes sparrows, crows, and once even a goose at a pond nearby. The size of the goose had startled him, the weight of it when he scooped it from the edge of the water, its long neck hanging limp and heavy across his right arm. The other birds he had shown to his friends, trophies of a sort, all in fun. But the thought that anyone else should see the goose scared him. He spent hours burying it and trying to make the ground look as it had before.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For years afterward, he would toe the ground in that spot, wondering to himself whether the whole thing was real. At the age of fifteen, he dug it up and found the fragile bones. It was the only way he could be sure of what he’d done.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">That was the first time in his life that he truly felt the weight of consequence.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He stopped going to the doctors, began to seek alternative forms of therapy. Acupuncture, herbal medicine. He found a voodoo priest who told him he was cursed, that somebody had put a jinx on him.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">“That can’t be it,” Rosen said. “Only important people get jinxed. I’m not important.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Still, he went through the ceremony. Every night for a week, he rubbed an egg over his heart and stomach, then sealed it in a bag that he kept under his bed. At the end of the week, he threw the egg into a nearby stream. But the liquid and the dreams kept coming.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">One day, at the noodle shop, he broke down and started crying into his soup. He told the couple everything, as the deliveryman came in and out.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The man patted him on his shoulder. “Speak to Wanda,” he said, “She knows things.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Wanda was an old woman, a psychic who wore long dresses of trailing red silk that may once have fit her but now were far too large. She worked out of a second&#45;floor condo, and on the stairwell, there were pots with dead flowers on every other step.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;“It’s trying to kill you, you know?” she said before he had even said hello. “Drowning you from the inside.” She handed him a piece of paper from behind a half&#45;open door. “I’d thank you not to come back, you don’t mind.”</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The paper had an address written on it.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">That night, the dreams were worse than ever. He woke in a sweat. His side throbbed, and he could feel his pulse through the hot, tight skin of his abdomen. The liquid poured out in a fast stream, so much that he felt certain it would not stop, or that it would deflate him, that everything inside of him had turned into this thick, black liquid and he would be left with nothing when it was gone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The address was of an old warehouse on the docks, where they used to store caught fish in huge vats of water from the boats, where the fish would be packed so tightly that they had no room to swim and the whole tank would creak with their frantic motions.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Rosen’s father had been a fishmonger in town. Every morning, he would come down and watch them dip nets into the tanks, pull them up, and dump the wriggling black figures on the cold concrete floor. One morning, when he brought Rosen with him, a man who was tugging on a caught net, trying to free it, had fallen in. Rosen had seen the man fall first, and not understanding, he had laughed. The other workers threw net after net, but the movements of the fish turned the water into quicksand. They battered the worker’s body, so that when the tank was finally emptied, he seemed hardly human.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">The fishing industry had shrunk and changed. Now the tanks sat unused, half&#45;filled with stale water covered by a slick, black scum. Rosen climbed one of the ladders on the edge, bent over, and ran his fingers across the surface. The liquid gathered together and gave him a small window into the waters below.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">There he saw movement, a twisting mess of shapes. He leaned further, came closer to the edge of the water. He pushed away the black scum with both hands. It stained his skin, stuck to the hairs on his arms. But slowly, it gathered at the edges of the tank.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He could see a mess of long, red lines, curving and twisting in the depths of the tank. And then an eye, large and brown like a cow’s.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He had seen an octopus before—often, his father would lay them out on a bed of ice, stringing their tentacles between his fingers like strands of fresh pasta. But they were always small, no larger than a cod. This creature splayed out across the whole bottom of the tank, and its tentacles crept up at the edge, pulling it forward with a slow, steady rhythm. It pushed itself up, and its left eye came close to the surface of the water, beneath Rosen’s face, where he could see the full size of the thing—a small boat, a car.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Rosen pulled away. He jumped down from the edge of the tank and ran out of the warehouse, into the mid&#45;morning sun.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">For the rest of the day, he sat in his apartment and tried to make sense of what he had seen. It was impossible, that the creature could live there and survive so long alone.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">His stomach churned. He ran to the bathroom, and when he threw up into the toilet, it was the same black liquid. He could feel it filling him, finding or making holes in the soft tissue of his body. He felt it slipping its way through his stomach, pushing on the bottoms of his lungs. He opened the tap, but as fast as it poured out, he felt the pressure still building.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He ran to the kitchen and found a long, sharp skewer.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">When he broke the skin, the pain was overrun by his sense of relief. The pressure lessened, and the second stream of black liquid arced, twisting, alongside the tap.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;He didn’t have much time.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He drove back to the old warehouse, holding a towel tight against his stomach and watching its color change to a rich black.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He took a shovel from a pile of rusted tools and used it to skim the top of the tank, throwing out all of the scum, until he could see the creature clearly.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">It was there, alive and real. It moved, it twisted. It followed him with its large, knowing eyes.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">Rosen reached down to the edge of the tank where one of the creature’s tentacles was curling its way up toward him. He ran his fingers along its slick surface and felt its suckers cling to his skin.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">He let himself be pulled forward, down to the water edge, to the eye of the beast. He saw there in the murky darkness his own face reflected, a pale circle with an open mouth, gaping wide, again and again, like a dying fish, like a man laughing or trying to scream.</h3>
    <h3 class="Main-Text">&nbsp;</h3>
